This python script/module mimics a code that  creates a solution vector (CSV in this case) that
can be used by another code to restart a calculation. The solution vector is contained
in a filename that is dumped as well.
The  'restart' file name can be retrieved by RAVEN and stored in a RAVEN variable.

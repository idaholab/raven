# Matrix with 6 columns defining the initial value calculation
# (columns 5 and 6 are not utilized for the calculation but are
#  reported by dymosim via dymosim -i for user convenience):
#
# column 1: Type of initial value
#           = -2: special case: for continuing simulation (column 2 = value)
#           = -1: fixed value (column 2 = fixed value)
#           =  0: free value, i.e., no restriction (column 2 = initial value)
#           >  0: desired value (column 1 = weight for optimization
#                                column 2 = desired value)
#                 use weight=1, since automatic scaling usually
#                 leads to equally weighted terms
# column 2: fixed, free or desired value according to column 1.
# column 3: Minimum value (ignored, if Minimum >= Maximum).
# column 4: Maximum value (ignored, if Minimum >= Maximum).
#           Minimum and maximum restrict the search range in initial
#           value calculation. They might also be used for scaling.
# column 5: Category of variable.
#           = 1: parameter.
#           = 2: state.
#           = 3: state derivative.
#           = 4: output.
#           = 5: input.
#           = 6: auxiliary variable.
# column 6: Data type of variable and flags according to dsBaseType
#  <value>&3= 0: real.
#  <value>&3= 1: boolean.
#  <value>&3= 2: integer.
#
# Initial values are calculated according to the following procedure:
#
# - If parameters, states and inputs are FIXED, and other variables
#   are FREE, no special action takes place (default setting).
#
# - If there are only FIXED and FREE variables and the number of
#   FREE parameters, states and inputs is IDENTICAL to the number of
#   FIXED state derivatives, outputs and auxiliary variables, a non-linear
#   equation is solved to determine a consistent set of initial conditions.
#
# - In all other cases the following optimization problem is solved:
#      min( sum( weight(i)*( (value(i) - DESIRED(i))/scale(i) )^2 ) )
#   under the constraint that the differential equation is fulfilled
#   at the initial time. In most cases weight(i)=1 is sufficient, due
#   to the automatic scaling (if DESIRED(i) is not close to zero,
#   scale(i) = DESIRED(i). Otherwise, the scaling is based on the
#   nominal value (and maybe minimum and maximum values given in 
#   column 3 and 4). If these values are zero, scale(i)=1 is used).

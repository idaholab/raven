# Simulates time-dependent track of a projectile through the air from start to 0,
#     assuming no air resistance.
#     Inputs:
#       (x0,y0) - initial position
#       v0 - initial total velocity
#       ang - angle of initial motion, in degrees, with respect to flat ground
#     Outputs:
#       (x,y) - vector positions of projectile in time
#       t - corresponding time steps

[Tests]
 # NOTE the ARMA training optimization sequence is often very, very dependent on small changes in values.
 # As a result, it is very difficult to get the same results on slightly different systems, such as different operating systems.
 # By way of comparison, running the test_ARMA.xml input and comparing the first entry in the first sampled history, the following
 # operating system results are obtained, each with identical python library installations, with both crow and numpy seeded identically::
 # MAC OSX (10.12.6): 9.457661108
 # Windows 7 Test   : 9.457661214
 # Ubuntu 16.04 LTS : 9.457659911
 # Ubuntu 18.04 LTS : 9.466078333
 # As we can observe, we at most can rely on 2 digits of similarity even on the first point.
 # A good alternative for non-correlated ARMAs is to run statistics on the results (mean, variance) and check those instead.

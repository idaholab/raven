The boost contribs are from boost 1.83, and were selected with the command:
dist/bin/bcp boost/math/distributions.hpp boost/math/distributions/*.hpp boost/random/mersenne_twister.hpp boost/numeric/ublas/matrix.hpp boost/numeric/ublas/lu.hpp boost/numeric/odeint.hpp /tmp/foo

and then /tmp/foo/boost was copied into the contrib directory.


The eigen contribs are from Eigen 3.2.6

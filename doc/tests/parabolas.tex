\section{Parabolas}
Associated external model: \texttt{parabolas.py}

This model is a simple $N$-dimensional parabolic response $u(Y)$,
\begin{equation}
  u(Y) = \sum_{n=1}^N -y_n^2,
\end{equation}
where the uncertain inputs are $Y=(y_1,\cdots,y_N)$ and can be defined arbitrarily.  For optimization
searches, it is possible to obtain a maximum in the interior of the input by assuring the range of each
input variable include 0.  In this case, the maximum point will be ${0}^N$.

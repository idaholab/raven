\section{Fourier}

Some signal processing tests make use of Fourier-based signals for analytic tests.

In constructing a Fourier signal, we use the formulation

\begin{equation}
  f(t) = \sum_{k} \sin\frac{2\pi}{k\in\Lambda}t + \cos\frac{2\pi}{k}t,\hspace{20pt}\Lambda\in\Bbb R^N,
\end{equation}
where the choice of periods $\Lambda$ is any arbitrary set of real numbers and can have any dimensionality.

If the resulting signal is treated by a fast fourier transform, it should show peaks at the frequencies
corresponding to the selected periods, where frequencies are simply the inverse of the periods.

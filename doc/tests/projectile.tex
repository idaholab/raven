\section{Projectile (vacuum, gravity)}
Associated external model: \texttt{projectile.py}

Solves the projectile motion equations
\begin{equation}
  x = x_0 + v_{x,0} t,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  y = y_0 + v_{y,0} t + \frac{a}{2} t^2,
\end{equation}
with the following inputs
\begin{itemize}
  \item $x_0$, or \texttt{x0}, initial horizontal position,
  \item $y_0$, or \texttt{y0}, initial vertical position,
  \item $v_0$, or \texttt{v0}, initial speed (scalar),
  \item $\theta$, or \texttt{ang}, angle with respect to horizontal plane,
\end{itemize}
and following responses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $r$, or \texttt{r}, the horizontal distance traveled before hitting $y=0$,
  \item $x$, or \texttt{x}, the time-dependent horizontal position,
  \item $y$, or \texttt{y}, the time-dependent vertical position,
  \item $t$, or \texttt{time}, the series of time steps taken.
\end{itemize}
The simulation takes 10 equally spaced time steps from 0 to 1 second, inclusive, and returns all four values
as vector quantities.

\subsection{Grid, $x_0,y_0$}
If a Grid sampling strategy is used and the following distributions are applied to $x_0$ and $y_0$, with three
samples equally spaced on the CDF between 0.01 and 0.99 for each input, the following are some of the samples obtained.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $x_0$ is distributed normally with mean 0 and standard deviation 1,
  \item $y_0$ is distributed normally with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.2.
\end{itemize}

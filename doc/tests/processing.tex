\section{Processor Load}
Associated external model: \texttt{stress.py}

The entire purpose of this model is to keep a processor at 100 percent utilization for a specified interval.
It can be coupled with other models via an ensemble model to assure a calculation takes at least a certain
period of time.

The input to this model is \texttt{interval}, which determines the number of seconds at which the model should
run. The output is \texttt{done}, which always evaluates to 1.0.

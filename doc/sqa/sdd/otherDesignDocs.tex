\subsection{Other Design Documentation}

In addition to this document, an automatic software documentation
is generated every time a new CR (see def.) is approved. This
documentation is automatically extracted from the source code using
doxygen (see def.) and is available to developers at
\url{https://hpcsc.inl.gov/ssl/RAVEN/docs/classes.html}.

In order to generate(locally) a hard copy in ``html'' or ``latex'', any user/developer can 
launch the 
following command (in the raven directory):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
doxygen ./doc/doxygen/Doxyfile
\end{lstlisting}
Once the documentation is generated, any user/developer can navigate to the folder
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./doc/doxygen/latex
\end{lstlisting}
and type the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make refman.pdf
\end{lstlisting}
Once the command is executed, a ``pdf'' file named ``refman.pdf'' will be available.

The doxygen software is under configuration management process identified in
`` RAVEN Configuration Management '' PLN-5553.

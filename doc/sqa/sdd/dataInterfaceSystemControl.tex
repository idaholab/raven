\subsection{Data Design and Control}
The data transfer in the RAVEN software is fully standardized:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  \textbf{\textit{Input}}: API deployed by Code Interfaces and/or Model APIs;
  \item \textbf{\textit{Output}}: API deployed by the \textbf{DataObjects}  and \textbf{Databases}.
\end{itemize}
The documentation of these APIs is reported in the RAVEN user manual (\cite{RAVENuserManual})

\subsection{Human-Machine Interface Design} 
 There are no human system integration requirements associated with this software.
 \subsection{System Interface Design} 
RAVEN does not own any physical model. For this reason, it needs to be interfaced with external
or user input-defined
software representing the engine for simulating physical models (systems). 
The interface with external systems in the RAVEN software is fully standardized via clear APIs deployed by
 the \textbf{Models} entities.
The documentation of these APIs is reported in the RAVEN user manual (\cite{RAVENuserManual})

 \subsection{Security Structure} 
The software is accessible to the open-source community (Apache License, Version 2.0). No restrictions for downloading or redistributing is applicable.

 \section{REQUIREMENTS CROSS-REFERENCE} 
The requirements are detailed in SPC-2366, ``RAVEN Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Traceability Matrix''.

\paragraph{R-RA-2} 
RAVEN shall support importing/exporting data in CSV format.
\paragraph{R-RA-3} 
RAVEN shall support generating plots from the data it generates.
\paragraph{R-RA-4}

RAVEN shall be able to perform basic statistical analysis of generated data.
\paragraph{R-RA-6} 
RAVEN shall be able to perform advanced post processing of generated data, using data mining methodologies.

RAVEN shall be able to compute probability of failure based on generated data and goal functions
\subsubsection{Risk Mitigation}
\paragraph{R-RM-1} 
RAVEN shall be able to choose the values of a set of input parameters that minimize/maximize a goal function that depends on system output figure of merits and input parameters.
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\subsubsection{Infrastructure Support}
\paragraph{R-IS-1} 
RAVEN shall be able to parallelize running external codes.
\paragraph{R-IS-2}

\section{Introduction}
RAVEN is a flexible and multi-purpose uncertainty quantification (UQ), regression analysis, probabilistic risk assessment 
(PRA), data analysis and model optimization software.  
Its broad spectrum of application determined the need of an integrated design (see RAVEN SDD document for  details)
of the software aimed to integrate multiple requirements.
\\This document is aimed to report and explain the RAVEN software requirements. In addition, it reports the traceability matrix between software requirements and requirement tests (tests that testify the software is compliant
with respect its own requirements).

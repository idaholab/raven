  \item \xmlNode{Segment}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, provides an alternative way to build the ROM. When
    this mode is enabled, the subspace of the ROM (e.g. ``time'') will be divided into segments as
    requested, then a distinct ROM will be trained on each of the segments. This is especially helpful if
    during the subspace the ROM representation of the signal changes significantly. For example, if the signal
    is different during summer and winter, then a signal can be divided and a distinct ROM trained on the
    segments. By default, no segmentation occurs.

    To futher enable clustering of the segments, the \xmlNode{Segment} has the following attributes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlAttr{grouping}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field} enables the use of ROM subspace clustering in
        addition to segmenting if set to \xmlString{cluster}. If set to \xmlString{segment}, then performs
        segmentation without clustering. If clustering, then an additional node needs to be included in the
        \xmlNode{Segment} node, as described below.
        \default{segment}
    \end{itemize}

    This node takes the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{subspace}, \xmlDesc{string, required field} designates the subspace to divide. This
        should be the pivot parameter (often ``time'') for the ROM. This node also requires an attribute
        to determine how the subspace is divided, as well as other attributes, described below:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \xmlAttr{pivotLength}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field}, provides the value in the subspace
            that each segment should attempt to represent, independently of how the data is stored. For
            example, if the subspace has hourly resolution, is measured in seconds, and the desired
            segmentation is daily, the \xmlAttr{pivotLength} would be 86400.
            Either this option or \xmlAttr{divisions} must be provided.
          \item \xmlAttr{divisions}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, as an alternative to
            \xmlAttr{pivotLength}, this attribute can be used to specify how many data points to include in
            each subdivision, rather than use the pivot values. The algorithm will attempt to split the data
            points as equally as possible.
            Either this option or \xmlAttr{pivotLength} must be provided.
          \item \xmlAttr{shift}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, governs the way in which the subspace is
            treated in each segment. By default, the subspace retains its actual values for each segment; for
            example, if each segment is 4 hours long, the first segment starts at time 0, the second at 4
            hours, the third at 8 hours, and so forth. Options to change this behavior are \xmlString{zero}
            and \xmlString{first}. In the case of \xmlString{zero}, each segment restarts the pivot with the
            subspace value as 0, shifting all other values similarly. In the example above, the first segment
            would start at 0, the second at 0, and the third at 0, with each ending at 4 hours. Note that the
            pivot values are restored when the ROM is evaluated. Using \xmlString{first}, each segment
            subspace restarts at the value of the first segment. This is useful in the event subspace 0 is not
            a desirable value.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{Classifier}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field} associates a \xmlNode{PostProcessor}
        defined in the \xmlNode{Models} block to this segmentation. If clustering is enabled (see
        \xmlAttr{grouping} above), then this associated Classifier will be used to cluster the segmented ROM
        subspaces. The attributes \xmlAttr{class}=\xmlString{Models} and
        \xmlAttr{type}=\xmlString{PostProcessor} must be set, and the text of this node is the \xmlAttr{name}
        of the requested Classifier. Note this Classifier must be a valid Classifier; not all PostProcessors
        are suitable. For example, see the DataMining PostProcessor subtype Clustering.
      \item \xmlNode{clusterFeatures}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, if clustering then delineates
        the fundamental ROM features that should be considered while clustering. The available features are
        ROM-dependent, and an exception is raised if an unrecognized request is given. See individual ROMs
        for options. \default All ROM-specific options.
      \item \xmlNode{evalMode}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, one of \xmlString{truncated},
        \xmlString{full}, or \xmlString{clustered}, determines how the evaluations are
        represented, as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \xmlString{full}, reproduce the full signal using representative cluster segments,
          \item \xmlString{truncated}, reproduce a history containing exactly segment from each
            cluster placed back-to-back, with the \xmlNode{pivotParameter} spanning the clustered
            dimension. Note this will almost surely not be the same length as the original signal;
            information about indexing can be found in the ROM's XML metadata.
          \item \xmlString{clustered}, reproduce a N-dimensional object with the variable
            \texttt{\_ROM\_cluster} as one of the indexes for the ROM's sampled variables. Note that
            in order to use the option, the receiving \xmlNode{DataObject} should be of type
            \xmlNode{DataSet} with one of the indices being \texttt{\_ROM\_cluster}.
        \end{itemize}
     \item \xmlNode{evaluationClusterChoice}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, one of \xmlString{first} or
        \xmlString{random}, determines, if \xmlAttr{grouping}$=cluster$, which
        strategy needs to be followed for the evaluation stage. If ``first'', the
        first ROM (representative segmented ROM),in each cluster, is considered to
         be representative of the full space in the cluster (i.e. the evaluation is always performed
         interrogating the first ROM in each cluster); If ``random'', a random ROM, in each cluster,
         is choosen when an evaluation is requested.
	 \nb if ``first'' is used, there is \emph{substantial} memory savings when compared to using

\subsection{ROM}
\label{subsec:models_ROM}
A Reduced Order Model (ROM) is a mathematical model consisting of a fast
solution trained to predict a response of interest of a physical system.
%
The ``training'' process is performed by sampling the response of a physical
model with respect to variations of its parameters subject, for example, to
probabilistic behavior.
%
The results (outcomes of the physical model) of the sampling are fed into the
algorithm representing the ROM that tunes itself to replicate those results.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of ROMs, both internally developed and
imported through an external library called ``scikit-learn''~\cite{SciKitLearn}.

Currently in RAVEN, the ROMs are classified into several sub-types that, once chosen,
provide access to several different algorithms.
%
These sub-types are specified in the \xmlAttr{subType} attribute and should be
one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlString{GaussPolynomialRom}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{HDMRRom}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{NDinvDistWeight}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{NDSpline}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{SciKitLearn}, for both static and time-dependent regression and classification
  \item \xmlString{MSR}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{ARMA}, for time-dependent stochastic regression (time series generator)
  \item \xmlString{PolyExponential}, for time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{DMD}, for time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{KerasMLPClassifier}, for deep neuron network
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \nameDescription
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines which of
  the sub-types should be used, choosing among the previously reported
  types.
  %
  This choice conditions the subsequent the required and/or optional
  \xmlNode{ROM} sub-nodes.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

In the \xmlNode{ROM} input block, the following XML sub-nodes are required,
independent of the \xmlAttr{subType} specified:
%
\begin{itemize}
  %
   \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
     specifies the names of the features of this ROM.
   \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this object
    (see Section~\ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer});
    \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
      contains a comma separated list of the targets of this ROM. These parameters
      are the Figures of Merit (FOMs) this ROM is supposed to predict.
    \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this
    object (see Section \ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer}).
\end{itemize}

If a time-dependent ROM is requested, a \textbf{HistorySet} should be provided.
The temporal vairable specified in the \textbf{HistorySet} should be also listed
as sub-nodes inside \xmlNode{ROM}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, optional parameter}, specifies the pivot
    variable (e.g. time, etc) used in the input HistorySet.
    \default{time}
\end{itemize}
%
In addition, if the user wants to use the alias system, the following XML block can be inputted:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \aliasSystemDescription{ROM}
\end{itemize}


The types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes depend on the sub-type
specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.

%
Note that if an HistorySet is provided in the training step then a temporal ROM is created, i.e. a ROM that generates not a single value prediction of each element indicated in the  \xmlNode{Target} block but its full temporal profile.

\end{equation}
\\In the following sections the specifications of each ROM type are reported, highlighting when a \textbf{Z-score normalization} is performed by RAVEN before constructing the ROM or when it is not performed.

%%%%% ROM Model - NDspline  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{NDspline}
\label{subsubsec:NDspline}
The NDspline sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on an $N$-dimensional
spline interpolation/extrapolation scheme.
%
In spline interpolation, the regressor is a special type of piece-wise
polynomial called tensor spline.
%
The interpolation error can be made small even when using low degree polynomials
for the spline.
%
Spline interpolation avoids the problem of Runge's phenomenon, in which
oscillation can occur between points when interpolating using higher degree
polynomials.
%

In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{NDspline} (see the example below).
%
No further XML sub-nodes are required.
%
\nb This ROM type must be trained from a regular Cartesian grid.
%
Thus, it can only be trained from the outcomes of a grid sampling strategy.

%%%%% ROM Model - GaussPolynomialRom  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{pickledROM}
\label{subsubsec:pickledROM}
It is not uncommon for a reduced-order model (ROM) to be created and trained in one RAVEN run, then
serialized to file (\emph{pickled}), then loaded into another RAVEN run to be used as a model.  When this is
the case, a \xmlNode{ROM} with subtype \xmlString{pickledROM} is used to hold the place of the ROM that will
be loaded from file.  The notation for this ROM is much less than a typical ROM; it only requires a name and
its subtype.

Note that when loading ROMs from file, RAVEN will not perform any checks on the expected inputs or outputs of
a ROM; it is expected that a user know at least the I/O of a ROM before trying to use it as a model.
However, RAVEN does require that pickled ROMs be trained before pickling in the first place.

Initially, a pickledROM is not usable.  It cannot be trained or sampled; attempting to do so will raise an
error.  An \xmlNode{IOStep} is used to load the ROM from file, at which point the ROM will have all the same
characteristics as when it was pickled in a previous RAVEN run.

\textbf{Example:}
For this example the ROM has already been created and trained in another RAVEN run, then pickled to a file
called \texttt{rom\_pickle.pk}.  In the example, the file is identified in \xmlNode{Files}, the model is
defined in \xmlNode{Models}, and the model loaded in \xmlNode{Steps}.

\subsubsection{GaussPolynomialRom}
\label{subsubsec:GaussPolynomialRom}
The GaussPolynomialRom sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on a
characteristic Gaussian polynomial fitting scheme: generalized polynomial chaos
expansion (gPC).
%
In gPC, sets of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the distribution of uncertainty
are used to represent the original model.  The method converges moments of the original
model faster than Monte Carlo for small-dimension uncertainty spaces ($N<15$).
%
In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{GaussPolynomialRom} (see the example below).
%
The GaussPolynomialRom is dependent on specific sampling; thus, this ROM cannot be trained unless a
SparseGridCollocation or similar Sampler specifies this ROM in its input and is sampled in a MultiRun step.
%
In addition to the common \xmlNode{Target} and \xmlNode{Features}, this ROM requires
two more nodes and can accept multiple entries of a third optional node.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{IndexSet}, \xmlDesc{string, required field},
  specifies the rules by which to construct multidimensional polynomials.  The options are
  \xmlString{TensorProduct}, \xmlString{TotalDegree},\\
  \xmlString{HyperbolicCross}, and \xmlString{Custom}.
  %
  Total degree is efficient for
  uncertain inputs with a large degree of regularity, while hyperbolic cross is more efficient
  for low-regularity input spaces.
  %
  If \xmlString{Custom} is chosen, the \xmlNode{IndexPoints} is required.
  %
  \item \xmlNode{PolynomialOrder}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field},
  indicates the maximum polynomial order in any one dimension to use in the
  polynomial chaos expansion. \nb If non-equal importance weights are supplied in the optional
  \xmlNode{Interpolation} node, the actual polynomial order in dimensions with high
  importance might exceed this value; however, this value is still used to limit the
  relative overall order.
  %
  \item \xmlNode{SparseGrid},\xmlDesc{string, optional field}, allows specification of the multidimensional
    quadrature construction strategy.  Options are \xmlString{smolyak} and \xmlString{tensor}.  Default is
    \xmlString{smolyak}.
  \item \xmlNode{IndexPoints}, \xmlDesc{list of tuples, required field},
  used to specify the index set points in a \xmlString{Custom} index set.  The tuples are
  entered as comma-seprated values between parenthesis, with each tuple separated by a comma.
  Any amount of whitespace is acceptable.  For example, \xmlNode{IndexPoints}\verb'(0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(4,0)'\xmlNode{/IndexPoints}
  \nb{Using custom index sets
  does not guarantee accurate convergence.}
  %
  \item \xmlNode{Interpolation}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field},
  offers the option to specify quadrature, polynomials, and importance weights for the given
  variable name.  The ROM accepts any number of \xmlNode{Interpolation} nodes up to the
  dimensionality of the input space.  This node accepts several attributes, all of which are
  optional and default to
  the code-defined optimal choices based on the input dimension uncertainty distribution:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlAttr{quad}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field},
      specifies the quadrature type to use for collocation in this dimension.  The default options
      depend on the uncertainty distribution of the input dimension, as shown in Table
      \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}. Additionally, Clenshaw Curtis quadrature can be used for any
      distribution that doesn't include an infinite bound.
      \default{see Table \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}.}
      \nb For an uncertain distribution aside from the four listed on Table
      \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}, this ROM
      makes use of the uniform-like range of the distribution's CDF to apply quadrature that is
      suited uniform uncertainty (Legendre).  It converges more slowly than the four listed, but are
      viable choices.  Choosing polynomial type Legendre for any non-uniform distribution will
      enable this formulation automatically.
    \item \xmlAttr{poly}, \xmlDesc{string,optional field},
      specifies the interpolating polynomial family to use for the polynomial expansion in this
      dimension.  The default options depend on the quadrature type chosen, as shown in Table
      \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}.  Currently, no polynomials are available outside the
      default. \default{see Table \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}.}
    \item  \xmlAttr{weight}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field},
      delineates the importance weighting of this dimension.  A larger importance weight will
      result in increased resolution for this dimension at the cost of resolution in lower-weighted
      dimensions.  The algorithm normalizes weights at run-time.\default{1}.

    shown in the XML print.
\end{itemize}

%%%%% ROM Model - HDMRRom  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{HDMRRom}
\label{subsubsec:HDMRRom}
The HDMRRom sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on a Sobol decomposition scheme.
%
In Sobol decomposition, also known as high-density model reduction (HDMR, specifically Cut-HDMR),
a model is approximated as as the sum of increasing-complexity interactions.  At its lowest level (order 1), it treats the function as a sum of the reference case plus a functional of each input dimesion separately.  At order 2, it adds functionals to consider the pairing of each dimension with each other dimension.  The benefit to this approach is considering several functions of small input cardinality instead of a single function with large input cardinality.  This allows reduced order models like generalized polynomial chaos (see \ref{subsubsec:GaussPolynomialRom}) to approximate the functionals accurately with few computations runs.
%
In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{HDMRRom} (see the example below).
%
The HDMRRom is dependent on specific sampling; thus, this ROM cannot be trained unless a
Sobol or similar Sampler specifies this ROM in its input and is sampled in a MultiRun step.
%
In addition to the common \xmlNode{Target} and \xmlNode{Features}, this ROM requires
the same nodes as the GaussPolynomialRom (see \ref{subsubsec:GaussPolynomialRom}.
Additionally, this ROM requires the \xmlNode{SobolOrder} node.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{SobolOrder}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field},
  indicates the maximum cardinality of the input space used in the subset functionals.  For example, order 1
  includes only functionals of each independent dimension separately, while order 2 considers pair-wise
  interactions.
  %
\end{itemize}
\nb This ROM type must be trained from a Sobol decomposition training set.
%
Thus, it can only be trained from the outcomes of a Sobol sampler.
Also, this ROM must be referenced in the Sobol sampler in order to
accurately produce the necessary sparse grid points to train this ROM.
Experience has shown order 2 Sobol decompositions to include the great majority of
  uncertainty in most models.

%%%%% ROM Model - MSR  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{MSR}
\label{subsubsec:MSR}
The MSR sub-type contains a class of ROMs that perform a topological
decomposition of the data into approximately monotonic regions and fits weighted
linear patches to the identified monotonic regions of the input space. Query
points have estimated probabilities that they belong to each cluster. These
probabilities can eitehr be used to give a smooth, weighted prediction based on
the associated linear models, or a hard classification to a particular local
linear model which is then used for prediction. Currently, the probability
prediction can be done using kernel density estimation (KDE) or through a
one-versus-one support vector machine (SVM).
%

In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{MSR} (see the associated example).

\subsubsection{NDinvDistWeight}
\label{subsubsec:NDinvDistWeight}
The NDinvDistWeight sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on an
$N$-dimensional inverse distance weighting formulation.
%
Inverse distance weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method for
multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points.
%
The assigned values to unknown points are calculated via a weighted average of
the values available at the known points.
%

In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be xmlString{NDinvDistWeight} (see the example
below).
%
\subnodeIntro

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{p}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field}, must be greater than
  zero and represents the ``power parameter''.
  %
  For the choice of value for \xmlNode{p},it is necessary to consider the degree
  of smoothing desired in the interpolation/extrapolation, the density and
  distribution of samples being interpolated, and the maximum distance over
  which an individual sample is allowed to influence the surrounding ones (lower
  $p$ means greater importance for points far away).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{SKLtype}, \xmlDesc{vertical bar (\texttt{|}) separated string,
  required field}, contains a string that represents the ROM type to be used.
  %
  As mentioned, its format is:\\

  first word (before the ``\texttt{|}'' symbol) represents the main class of
  algorithms, and the second word (after the ``\texttt{|}'' symbol) represents
  the specific algorithm.
  %
\end{itemize}
Based on the \xmlNode{SKLtype} several different algorithms are available.
%
\nb for HistorySet's \xmlString{SciKitLearn} performs the task given in \xmlNode{SKLtype} for

\subparagraph{Linear Model: Automatic Relevance Determination Regression}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Automatic Relevance Determination} (ARD) regressor is a
hierarchical Bayesian approach where hyperparameters explicitly represent the
relevance of different input features.
%
These relevance hyperparameters determine the range of variation for the
parameters relating to a particular input, usually by modelling the width of a
zero-mean Gaussian prior on those parameters.
%
If the width of the Gaussian is zero, then those parameters are constrained to
be zero, and the corresponding input cannot have any effect on the predictions,
therefore making it irrelevant.
%
ARD optimizes these hyperparameters to discover which inputs are relevant.

The \textit{Bayesian ridge regression} estimates a probabilistic model of the

The prior for the parameter $w$ is given by a spherical Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
p(w|\lambda) =\mathcal{N}(w|0,\lambda^{-1}\bold{I_{p}})
\end{equation}
The priors over $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are chosen to be gamma distributions, the
conjugate prior for the precision of the Gaussian.
%
The resulting model is called Bayesian ridge regression, and is similar to the
classical ridge regression.
%
The parameters $w$, $\alpha$, and $\lambda$ are estimated jointly during the fit
of the model.

The remaining hyperparameters are the parameters of the gamma priors over
$\alpha$ and $\lambda$.

These are usually chosen to be non-informative.

training} implements regularized linear models with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) learning: the gradient of the loss is estimated for each sample at
a time and the model is updated along the way with a decreasing strength

%
SGD allows minibatch (online/out-of-core) learning, see the partial\_fit method.
%
This implementation works with data represented as dense or sparse arrays of
floating point values for the features.
%
The model it fits can be controlled with the loss parameter; by default, it fits
a linear support vector machine (SVM).

The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model
parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared Euclidean norm L2 or
the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net).
%
If the parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the
update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieves
online feature selection.

%%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Support Vector Machines %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Support Vector Machines}
\label{SVM}
In machine learning, \textbf{Support Vector Machines} (SVMs, also support vector
networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms
that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression
analysis.
%
Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two
categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples
into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear
classifier.
%
An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so
that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is
as wide as possible.
%
New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a
category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
%
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a
non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly
mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

\\The \textit{Linear Support Vector Classifier} is similar to SVC with parameter
kernel=`linear', but implemented in terms of liblinear rather than libsvm,
so it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and
should scale better (to large numbers of samples).

\paragraph{Multi Class}
\label{Multiclass}
Multiclass classification means a classification task with more than two
classes; e.g., classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples,
or pears.
%
Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to
one and only one label: a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at
the same time.

%%%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multiclass/multilabel strategy}
\mbox{}

The \textit{One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multiclass/multilabel strategy}, also known
as one-vs-all, consists in fitting one classifier per class.
%
For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes.
%
In addition to its computational efficiency (only n\_classes classifiers are
needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability.
%
Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible
to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier.
%
This is the most commonly used strategy and is a fair default choice.

\subparagraph{One-vs-one multiclass strategy}

The \textit{One-vs-one multiclass strategy} consists in fitting one classifier
per class pair.
%
At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected.
%
Since it requires to fit n\_classes * (n\_classes - 1) / 2 classifiers, this
method is usually slower than one-vs-the-rest, due to its O(n\_classes$^2$)
complexity.
%
However, this method may be advantageous for algorithms such as kernel
algorithms which do not scale well with n\_samples.
%
This is because each individual learning problem only involves a small subset of
the data whereas, with one-vs-the-rest, the complete dataset is used n\_classes
times.

\\The \textit{Error-Correcting Output-Code multiclass strategy} consists in
representing each class with a binary code (an array of 0s and 1s).
%
At fitting time, one binary classifier per bit in the code book is fitted.
%
At prediction time, the classifiers are used to project new points in the class
space and the class closest to the points is chosen.
%
The main advantage of these strategies is that the number of classifiers used
can be controlled by the user, either for compressing the model ($0 < code\_
size < 1$) or for making the model more robust to errors ($code\_ size > 1$).

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: naiveBayes %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Naive Bayes}
\label{naiveBayes}
Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on
applying Bayes' theorem with the ``naive'' assumption of independence between
every pair of features.
%
Given a class variable y and a dependent feature vector x\_1 through x\_n,
Bayes' theorem states the following relationship:
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{P(y) P(x_1, \dots x_n \mid y)}
{P(x_1, \dots, x_n)}
\end{equation}
Using the naive independence assumption that
\begin{equation}
P(x_i | y, x_1, \dots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_n) = P(x_i | y),
\end{equation}
for all i, this relationship is simplified to
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y)}
{P(x_1, \dots, x_n)}
\end{equation}
Since $P(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is constant given the input, we can use the following
classification rule:
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) \propto P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y)
\Downarrow
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \arg\max_y P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y),
\end{equation}
and we can use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate $P(y)$ and
$P(x_i \mid y)$; the former is then the relative frequency of class $y$ in the
training set.
%
The different naive Bayes classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make
regarding the distribution of $P(x_i \mid y)$.

In spite of their apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes
classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously
document classification and spam filtering.
%
They require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary
parameters.
%
(For theoretical reasons why naive Bayes works well, and on which types of data
it does, see the references below.)
Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more
sophisticated methods.
%
The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each
distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution.
%
This in turn helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of
dimensionality.

On the flip side, although naive Bayes is known as a decent classifier, it is
known to be a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict\_proba are
not to be taken too seriously.
%
In the following, all the Naive Bayes available in RAVEN are reported.
%
%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{Gaussian Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Gaussian Naive Bayes strategy} implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes
algorithm for classification.
%
The likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
P(x_i \mid y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_y}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x_i -
  \mu_y)^2}{2\sigma^2_y}\right)
\end{equation}
The parameters $\sigma_y$ and $\mu_y$ are estimated using maximum likelihood.

In order to use the \textit{Gaussian Naive Bayes strategy}, the user needs to
set the sub-node:

\xmlNode{SKLtype}\texttt{naiveBayes|GaussianNB}\xmlNode{/SKLtype}.

There are no additional sub-nodes available for this method.
%

\zNormalizationPerformed{GaussianNB}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{Multinomial Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Multinomial Naive Bayes} implements the naive Bayes algorithm for
multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes
variants used in text classification (where the data is typically represented
as word vector counts, although tf-idf vectors are also known to work well in
practice).
%
The distribution is parametrized by vectors $\theta_y =
(\theta_{y1},\ldots,\theta_{yn})$ for each class $y$, where $n$ is the number of
features (in text classification, the size of the vocabulary) and $\theta_{yi}$
is the probability $P(x_i \mid y)$ of feature $i$ appearing in a sample
belonging to class $y$.
%
The parameters $\theta_y$ are estimated by a smoothed version of maximum
likelihood, i.e. relative frequency counting:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}_{yi} = \frac{ N_{yi} + \alpha}{N_y + \alpha n}
\end{equation}
where $N_{yi} = \sum_{x \in T} x_i$ is the number of times feature $i$ appears
in a sample of class y in the training set T, and
$N_{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{|T|} N_{yi}$ is the total count of all features for class
$y$.
%
The smoothing priors $\alpha \ge 0$ account for features not present in the
learning samples and prevents zero probabilities in further computations.
%
Setting $\alpha = 1$ is called Laplace smoothing, while $\alpha < 1$ is called
Lidstone smoothing.

\subparagraph{Bernoulli Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Bernoulli Naive Bayes} implements the naive Bayes training and
classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate
Bernoulli distributions; i.e., there may be multiple features but each one is
assumed to be a binary-valued (Bernoulli, boolean) variable.
%
Therefore, this class requires samples to be represented as binary-valued
feature vectors; if handed any other kind of data, a \textit{Bernoulli Naive
Bayes} instance may binarize its input (depending on the binarize parameter).
%
The decision rule for Bernoulli naive Bayes is based on
\begin{equation}
P(x_i \mid y) = P(i \mid y) x_i + (1 - P(i \mid y)) (1 - x_i)
\end{equation}
which differs from multinomial NB's rule in that it explicitly penalizes the
non-occurrence of a feature $i$ that is an indicator for class $y$, where the
multinomial variant would simply ignore a non-occurring feature.
%
In the case of text classification, word occurrence vectors (rather than word
count vectors) may be used to train and use this classifier.
%
\textit{Bernoulli Naive Bayes} might perform better on some datasets, especially
those with shorter documents.
%
It is advisable to evaluate both models, if time permits.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Neighbors %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Neighbors}
\label{Neighbors}

The \textit{Neighbors} class provides functionality for unsupervised and
supervised neighbor-based learning methods.
%
The unsupervised nearest neighbors method is the foundation of many other
learning methods, notably manifold learning and spectral clustering.
%
Supervised neighbors-based learning comes in two flavors: classification for
data with discrete labels, and regression for data with continuous labels.

The principle behind nearest neighbor methods is to find a predefined number of
training samples closest in distance to the new point, and predict the label
from these.
%
The number of samples can be a user-defined constant (k-nearest neighbor
learning), or vary based on the local density of points (radius-based neighbor
learning).
%
The distance can, in general, be any metric measure: standard Euclidean distance
is the most common choice.
%
Neighbor-based methods are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods,
since they simply ``remember'' all of its training data (possibly transformed
into a fast indexing structure such as a Ball Tree or KD Tree.).

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Tree %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Tree}
\label{tree}

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for
classification and regression.
%
The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by
learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some advantages of decision trees are:
  \item Simple to understand and to interpret.
  %
  Trees can be visualized.
  %
  \item Requires little data preparation.
  %
  Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be
  created and blank values to be removed.
  %
  Note however, that this module does not support missing values.
  %
  \item The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the
  number of data points used to train the tree.
  %
  \item Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.
  %
  Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that have only
  one type of variable.
  %
  \item Able to handle multi-output problems.
  %
  \item Uses a white box model.
  %
  If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the
  condition is easily explained by boolean logic.
  %
  By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network),
  results may be more difficult to interpret.
  %
  \item Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.
  %
  That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.
  %
  \item Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true
  model from which the data were generated.
  %
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of decision trees include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not
  generalise the data well.
  %
  This is called overfitting.
  %
  Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum
  number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the
  tree are necessary to avoid this problem.
  %
  \item Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data
  might result in a completely different tree being generated.
  %
  This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.
  %
  \item The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be
  NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts.
  %
  Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on
  heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal
  decisions are made at each node.
  %
  Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree.
  %
  This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where
  the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.
  %
  \item There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not
  express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.
  %
  \item Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.
  %
  It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the
  decision tree.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Gaussian Process %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Gaussian Process}
\label{GP}
Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML) is a generic supervised learning
method primarily designed to solve regression problems.
%
The advantages of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prediction interpolates the observations (at least for regular
  correlation models).
  \item The prediction is probabilistic (Gaussian) so that one can compute
  empirical confidence intervals and exceedance probabilities that might be used
  to refit (online fitting, adaptive fitting) the prediction in some region of
  interest.
  \item Versatile: different linear regression models and correlation models can
  be specified.
  %
  Common models are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom models
  provided they are stationary.
  %
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is not sparse.
  %
  It uses the whole samples/features information to perform the prediction.
  \item It loses efficiency in high dimensional spaces – namely when the
  number of features exceeds a few dozens.
  %
  It might indeed give poor performance and it loses computational efficiency.
  \item Classification is only a post-processing, meaning that one first needs
  to solve a regression problem by providing the complete scalar float precision
  output $y$ of the experiment one is attempting to model.
  %
\end{itemize}

\skltype{Gaussian Process Regressor}{GaussianProcess|GaussianProcess}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{normalize\_y}, \xmlDesc{boolean, optional field}, if True, the
  observations $y$ are centered and reduced w.r.t. means and
  standard deviations estimated from the n\_samples observations provided.
  %
  \default{True}
  \item \xmlNode{optimizer}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, specifies the
  optimization algorithm to be used.
  %
  Available optimizers are: 'fmin\_cobyla', 'Welch'.
  %
  \default{fmin\_cobyla}
  \item \xmlNode{random\_state}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, is the seed
  of the internal random number generator.
  %
  \default{None}
  \item \xmlNode{n\_restarts\_optimizer }, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding
the kernel’s parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run of the optimizer is performed from th
e kernel’s initial parameters, the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly from the space of
allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds must be finite. Note that n\_restarts\_optimizer $== 0$ implies that one run is performed.
  %
  \default{0}
  %
  \item \xmlNode{alpha}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field}, Value added to the diagonal of the kernel matrix during fitting.
 Larger values correspond to increased noise level in the observations. This can also prevent a potential numerical issue
 during fitting, by ensuring that the calculated values form a positive definite matrix. If an array is passed, it must have the
 same number of entries as the data used for fitting and is used as datapoint-dependent noise level. Note that this is
 equivalent to adding a WhiteKernel with c=alpha. Allowing to specify the noise level directly as a parameter is mainly for
 convenience and for consistency with Ridge.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Neural Network Models %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Neural Network Models}
\label{DNN}
It has been more than 70 years since Warren McCulloch and Water Pitts modeled the first
artificial neural network (ANN) that mimicked the way brains work. These days, deep learning
based on ANN is showing outstanding results for solving a wide variety of robotic tasks in
the areas of perception, planning, localization, and control.
%
\textbf{Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)} is a supervised learning algorithm that can learn
a non-linear function approximator for either classifcation or regression. It is different
from logistic regression, in that between the input and output layer, there can be one
or more non-linear layers, called hidden layers.
%
The advantages of Multi-layer Perceptron are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Capability to learn non-linear models
  \item Capability to learn models in real-time (online learning)
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of Multi-layer Perceptron include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MLP with hidden layers have a non-convex loss function where there exists more than
    one local minimum. Therefore different random weight initializations can lead to different
    validation accuracy.
  \item MLP requires tuning a number of hyperparameters such as the number of hidden neurons, layers
    and iterations.
  \item MLP is sensitive to feature scaling
\end{itemize}

%%%% ROM Model - SyntheticHistory  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{SyntheticHistory}
% NOTE TODO: this ROM has the "descr" nodes fully filled in the InputSpecs.
\label{subsubsec:arma}
The SyntheticHistory sub-type uses various Time Series Analysis (TSA) algorithms to characterize and
reproduce synthetic histories. It is a more general implementation of the ARMA ROM. The available
algorithms are discussed in more detail below. The SyntheticHistory ROM uses the TSA algorithms to
characterize then reproduce time series in sequence; for example, if using Fourier then ARMA, the
SyntheticHistory ROM will characterize the Fourier properties using the Fourier TSA algorithm on a
training signal, then send the residual to the ARMA TSA algorithm for characterization. Generating
new signals works in reverse, first generating a signal using the ARMA TSA algorithm then
superimposing the Fourier TSA algorithm.

%
In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be \xmlString{SyntheticHistory} (see the example
below).
%
\subnodeIntro

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines the features (e.g., scaling). Note that only
  one feature is allowed for \xmlString{SyntheticHistory} and in current implementation this is used for evaluation only.
  \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines the variable(s) of the
    time series.  Should include the pivot parameter (or Index).
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, defines the pivot variable (e.g., time) that is non-decreasing in
  the input HistorySet.
\end{itemize}

In addition, any number of the following TSA algorithms may be included as subnodes of this ROM:

\begin{itemize}
  %%%%% Wavelet %%%%%
\item \xmlNode{Wavelet} performs a discrete wavelet transform on time-dependent
  data. Note: This TSA module requires pywavelets to be installed within your
  python environment.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlAttr{target}, \xmlDesc{comma sperated string, require field},
    indicates which target sigals should be trained as part of this ROM using this

    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  %%%%% PolynomialRegression %%%%%
\item \xmlNode{PolynomialRegression} fits time-series data using a polynomial function of degree one or greater.

  \xmlNode{PolynomialRegression} has the following attributes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlAttr{target}, \xmlDesc{comma seperated string, required field}, indicates which
        target signals should be trained as part of this ROM using this TSA algorithm.
  \end{itemize}

  \xmlNode{PolynomialRegression} has the following subnodes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{degree}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field}, indicates which
    degree of polynomial to fit to the presented data.
  \end{itemize}

  %%%%% FOURIER %%%%%
  \item \xmlNode{Fourier} uses regression to fit requested Fourier bases by their amplitudes to
    deterministically match the training signal. Fourier signals are defined with the following form:
    \begin{equation*}
      F_m(t) = C_m\sin\left( \frac{2\pi}{k_m}t + \phi_m\right)
    \end{equation*}
    where $m$ indexes a particular base period $k_m$, $C_m$ is the amplitude of this Fourier base in the
    training signal, and $\phi_m$ is the phase shift of this Fourier base in the training signal.

    \xmlNode{Fourier} has the following parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlAttr{target}, \xmlDesc{comma seperated string, required field}, indicates which
        target signals should be trained as part of this ROM using this TSA algorithm.
      \item \xmlAttr{seed}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional}, provides a static seed to be used for
        random number generation in this ROM. Unused for the Fourier TSA algorithm.
    \end{itemize}
    \xmlNode{Fourier} further has the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{periods}, \xmlDesc{comma seperated floats, required field}, indicates which base
        periods whose Fourier reperesentations should be fit to the training signal. For example, in
        a signal with hourly measurements, selecting the period \xmlString{12, 24} would fit the daily
        (24-hour) and half-daily (12-hour) periodic trends.
    \end{itemize}

  %%%%% ARMA %%%%%
  \item \xmlNode{ARMA} characterizes the signal using Auto-Regressive and Moving Average
    coefficients to stochastically fit the training signal.
    The ARMA representation has the following form:
    \begin{equation*}
      A_t = \sum_{i=1}^P \phi_i A_{t-i} + \epsilon_t + \sum_{j=1}^Q \theta_j \epsilon_{t-j},
    \end{equation*}
    where $t$ indicates a discrete time step, $\phi$ are the signal lag (or auto-regressive)
    coefficients, $P$ is the number of signal lag terms to consider, $\epsilon$ is a random noise
    term, $\theta$ are the noise lag (or moving average) coefficients, and $Q$ is the number of
    noise lag terms to consider. The ARMA algorithms are developed in RAVEN using the
    \texttt{statsmodels} Python library.

    \xmlNode{ARMA} has the following parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlAttr{target}, \xmlDesc{comma seperated string, required field}, indicates which
        target signals should be trained as part of this ROM using this TSA algorithm.
      \item \xmlAttr{seed}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional}, provides a static seed to be used for
        random number generation in this ROM. This applies both to the training and sampling of this
        ROM.
      \item \xmlAttr{reduce\_memory}, \xmlDesc{boolean, optional field}, activates a lower memory
        usage ARMA training. This does tend to result
        in a slightly slower training time, at the benefit of lower memory usage. For
        example, in one 1000-length history test, low memory reduced memory usage by 2.3
        MiB (80\%), but increased training time by 0.4 seconds (20\%). No change in results has been
        observed switching between modes. Note that the ARMA must be
        retrained to change this property; it cannot be applied to serialized ARMAs.
        \default{False}
    \end{itemize}
    \xmlNode{ARMA} further has the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{SignalLag}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field}, number of signal lag terms to
        include in the autoregression term.
      \item \xmlNode{NoiseLag}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field}, number of noise lag terms to
        include in the moving average term.
    \end{itemize}

%%%% ROM Model - ARMA  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ARMA}
\label{subsubsec:arma}
The ARMA sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on an autoregressive moving average time series model with
Fourier signal processing, sometimes referred to as a FARMA.
%
ARMA is a type of time dependent model that characterizes the autocorrelation between time series data. The mathematic description of ARMA is given as
\begin{equation*}
x_t = \sum_{i=1}^p\phi_ix_{t-i}+\alpha_t+\sum_{j=1}^q\theta_j\alpha_{t-j},
\end{equation*}
where $x$ is a vector of dimension $n$, and $\phi_i$ and $\theta_j$ are both $n$ by $n$ matrices. When $q=0$, the above is
autoregressive (AR); when $p=0$, the above is moving average (MA).
When
training an ARMA, the input needs to be a synchronized HistorySet. For unsynchronized data, use PostProcessor methods to
synchronize the data before training an ARMA.

The ARMA model implemented allows an option to use Fourier series to detrend the time series before fitting to ARMA model to
train. The Fourier trend will be stored in the trained ARMA model for data generation. The following equation
describes the detrending
process.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
x_t &= y_t - \sum_m\left\{a_m\sin(2\pi f_mt)+b_m\cos(2\pi f_mt)\right\}  \\
&=y_t - \sum_m\ c_m\sin(2\pi f_mt+\phi_m)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

where $1/f_m$ is defined by the user parameter \xmlNode{Fourier}. \nb $a_m$ and $b_m$ will be calculated then transformed to
$c_m$ and $\phi$. The $c_m$ will be stored as \xmlString{amplitude}, and $\phi$ will be stored as \xmlString{phase}.

By default, each target in the training will be considered independent and have an unique ARMA for each
target.  Correlated targets can be specified through the \xmlNode{correlate} node, at which point
the correlated targets will be trained together using a vector ARMA (or VARMA). Due to limitations in
the VARMA, in order to seed samples the VARMA must be trained with the node \xmlNode{seed}, which acts
independently from the global random seed used by other RAVEN entities.

Both the ARMA and VARMA make use of the \texttt{statsmodels} python package.

%
In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be \xmlString{ARMA} (see the example
below).
%
\subnodeIntro

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, defines the pivot variable (e.g., time) that is non-decreasing in
  the input HistorySet.
  \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines the features (e.g., scaling). Note that only
  one feature is allowed for \xmlString{ARMA} and in current implementation this is used for evaluation only.
  \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines the variable(s) of the
    time series.  Should include the pivot parameter (or Index).
  \item \xmlNode{correlate}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, optional field}, indicates the listed variables
    should be considered as influencing each other, and trained together instead of independently.  This node
    can only be listed once, so all variables that are desired for correlation should be included.  \nb The
    correlated VARMA takes notably longer to train than the independent ARMAs for the same number of targets.
  \item \xmlNode{seed}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, provides seed for VARMA and ARMA sampling.
   Must be provided before training. If no seed is assigned,
   then a random number will be used.

   \item \xmlNode{reseedCopies}, \xmlDesc{boolean, optional field}, if \xmlString{True} then whenever the ARMA is loaded from file, a
    random reseeding will be performed to ensure different histories. \nb If reproducible histories are desired for an ARMA loaded from file,
    \xmlNode{reseedCopies} should be set to \xmlString{False}, and in the \xmlNode{RunInfo} block \xmlNode{batchSize} needs to be 1
    and \xmlNode{internalParallel} should be
     \xmlString{False} for RAVEN runs sampling the trained ARMA model.

If \xmlNode{InternalParallel} is \xmlString{True} and the ARMA has \xmlNode{reseedCopies} as \xmlString{False}, an identical ARMA history will always be provided regardless of how many samples are taken.

If \xmlNode{InternalParallel} is \xmlString{False} and \xmlNode{batchSize} is more than 1, it is not possible to guarantee the order of RNG usage by the separate processes, so it is not possible to guarantee reproducible histories are generated.        \default{True}

  \item \xmlNode{P}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the value of $p$.
  \default{3}
  \item \xmlNode{Q}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the value of $q$.
  \default{3}
  \item \xmlNode{Fourier}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated integers, optional field}, must be positive integers. This defines the
    based period that will be used for Fourier detrending, i.e., this field defines $1/f_m$ in the above equation.
    When this filed is not specified, the ARMA considers no Fourier detrend.
  \item \xmlNode{outTruncation}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated string, optional}, defines whether and how output
    time series are limited in domain. This node has one attribute, \xmlAttr{domain}, whose value can be
    \xmlString{positive} or \xmlString{negative}. The value of this node contains the list of targets to whom
    this domain limitation should be applied. In the event a negative value is discovered in a target whose
    domain is strictly positive, the absolute value of the original negative value will be used instead, and
    similarly for the negative domain.
  \default{None}


   \item \xmlNode{Peaks}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, designed to estimate the peaks in signals that repeat with some frequency,
   often in periodic data. The \xmlNode{Peaks} node has the following attributes:
  	\begin{itemize}
    		\item \xmlAttr{target}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines the name of one target (besides the
		pivot parameter) expected to have periodic peaks.
    		\item \xmlAttr{threshold}, \xmlDesc{required float attribute}, user-defined minimum required
		height of peaks (absolute value).
    		\item \xmlAttr{period}, \xmlDesc{required float attribute}, user-defined expected period for target variable.
	\end{itemize}

    	For example,
	\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={target,threshold,period}]
	<Peaks target='Speed' threshold='0' period='86400'>
	\end{lstlisting}
	This means the \xmlString{Speed} signal is a daily signal, and the minimal height required to define a peak is 0.
    Additionally, the \xmlNode{Peaks} requires the sub-node:
    	\begin{itemize}
      		 \item \xmlNode{window}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated floats, required field},
		 lists the window of time within each period in which a peak should be discovered.
		 The text of this node is the upper and lower boundary of this
		 window \emph{relative to} the start of the period, separated by a comma.
		 User can define the lower bound to be a negative
		 number if the window passes through one side of one period. For example, if the period is 24
		 hours, the window can be -2,2 which is equivalent to 22, 2.
		 This node has one attribute:
		 \begin{itemize}
		  \item \xmlAttr{width}, \xmlDesc{required float attribute} which is the
		 user defined  width of peaks in that window. The width is in the unit of the signal as well.
		 \end{itemize}
		 The number of \xmlNode{window} is unlimited.
       	\end{itemize}




  \item \xmlNode{preserveInputCDF}, \xmlDesc{boolean, optional field}, enables a final transform on sampled
    data coercing it to have the same distribution as the original data. If \xmlString{True}, then every
    sample generated by this ARMA after training will have a distribution of values that conforms within
    numerical accuracy to the original data. This is especially useful when variance is desired not to stretch
    the most extreme events (high or low signal values), but instead the sequence of events throughout this
    history. For example, this transform can preserve the load duration curve for a load signal.
    \default{False}
  \item \xmlNode{ZeroFilter}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated string, optional field}, turns on \emph{zero filtering}
    for the listed targets. Zero filtering is a very specific algorithm, and should not be used without
    understanding its application.  When zero filtering is enabled, the ARMA will remove all the values from
    the training data equal to zero for the target, then train on the remaining data (including Fourier detrending
    if applicable). If the target is set as correlated to another target, the second target will be treated as
    two distinct series: one containing times in which the original target is zero, and one in the remaining
    times. The results from separated ARMAs are recombined after sampling. This can be a methodology for
    treating histories with long zero-value segments punctuated periodically by peaks.
  \item \xmlNode{SpecificFourier}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, provides a means to specify different Fourier
    decomposition for different target variables.  Values given in the subnodes of this node will supercede
    the defaults set by the  \xmlNode{Fourier} and \xmlNode{FourierOrder} nodes.  This node
    requires the following attribute:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlAttr{variables}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated list, required field}, lists the variables to whom
        the \xmlNode{SpecificFourier} parameters will apply.
    \end{itemize}
    Additionally, the \xmlNode{SpecificFourier} node takes the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{periods}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated integers, required field}, lists the (fundamental)
        periodic wavelength of the Fourier decomposition for these variables, as in the \xmlNode{Fourier} general node.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{Multicycle}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, indicates that each sample of the ARMA should yield
    multiple sequential samples. For example, if an ARMA model is trained to produce a year's worth of data,
    enabling \xmlNode{Multicycle} causes it to produce several successive years of data. Multicycle sampling
    is independent of ROM training, and only changes how samples of the ARMA are created.

    \nb The output of a multicycle ARMA must be stored in a \xmlNode{DataSet}, as the targets will depend
      on both the \xmlNode{pivotParameter} as well as the cycle, \xmlString{Cycle}. The cycle is a second
      \xmlNode{Index} that all targets should depend on, with variable name \xmlString{Cycle}.

    The \xmlNode{Multicycle} node accepts the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{cycles}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field}, the number of cycles the ARMA should produce
        each time it yields a sample.
      \item \xmlNode{growth}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field}, if provided then the histories produced by
        the ARMA will be increased by the growth factor for successive cycles. This node can be added
        multiple times with different settings for different targets.
        The text of this node is the growth factor in percentage. Some examples are in
        Table~\ref{tab:arma multicycle growth}, where \emph{Growth factor} is the value used in the RAVEN
        input and \emph{Scaling factor} is the value by which the history will be multiplied.
        \begin{table}[h!]
          \centering
          \begin{tabular}{r c l}
            Growth factor & Scaling factor & Description \\ \hline
            50 & 1.5 & growing by 50\% each cycle \\
            -50 & 0.5 & shrinking by 50\% each cycle \\
            150 & 2.5 & growing by 150\% each cycle \\
          \end{tabular}
          \caption{ARMA Growth Factor Examples}
          \label{tab:arma multicycle growth}
        \end{table}

        The \xmlNode{growth} node takes the following attributes as settings:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \xmlAttr{targets}, \xmlDesc{comma-seperated list, required field}, lists the targets
            in this ARMA that this growth factor should apply to.
          \item \xmlAttr{mode}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, either \xmlString{linear} or
            \xmlString{exponential}, determines the manner in which the growth factor is applied.

            If \xmlString{linear}, then the scaling factor is $(1+y\cdot g/100)$;

            if \xmlString{exponential}, then the scaling factor is $(1+g/100)^y$;

            where $y$ is the cycle after the first and $g$ is the provided scaling factor.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \romClusterOption
\end{itemize}

Note that when loading the ARMA model from a serialized file as a \xmlNode{pickledROM},
several nodes can be used to modify the evaluation behavior:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{reseed}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional},
  \item \xmlNode{Multicycle}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, as \xmlNode{Multicycle} above, allows resetting
    a growth factor and number of cycles to sample.
  \item \xmlNode{clusterEvalMode}, \xmlDesc{string, optional}, one of \xmlString{truncated},
    \xmlString{full}, or \xmlString{clustered}, changes the structure of the samples for Clustered
    Segmented ROMs. These are identical to the options for \xmlNode{evalMode} node under \xmlNode{Segmented}
    as described above.
\end{itemize}
the \xmlNode{seed}
as well as the \xmlNode{Multicycle} nodes can be added to change the behavior of the ARMA ROM.

When using ROM segmentation/clustering, the ARMA provides the following classes of features that can
be used for clustering:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \xmlString{global}, the segment-long mean values of the signal;
   \item \xmlString{fourier}, the fundamental Fourier frequency amplitudes discovered during training;
   \item \xmlString{arma}, the standard deviation, $p$, and $q$ coefficients obtained during training;
   \item \xmlString{peak}, the peak probability, mean, standard deviation, and most probable index discovered during training.
\end{itemize}

%%%% ROM Model - PolyExponential  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{PolyExponential}
\label{subsubsec:polyexponential}
The PolyExponential sub-type contains a single ROM type, aimed to construct a time-dependent (or any other monotonic
variable) surrogate model based on polynomial sum of exponential term. This surrogate have the form:
%
\begin{equation}
  SM(X,z) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} P_{i}(X) \times \exp ( - Q_{i}(X) \times z )
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbf{z}$ is the independent  monotonic variable (e.g. time)
  \item $\mathbf{X}$  is the vector of the other independent (parametric) variables  (Features)
  \item $\mathbf{P_{i}}(X)$ is a polynomial of rank M function of the parametric space X
  \item  $\mathbf{Q_{i}}(X)$ is a polynomial of rank M function of the parametric space X
  \item  $\mathbf{N}$ is the number of requested exponential terms.
\end{itemize}
It is crucial to notice that this model is quite suitable for FOMs whose drivers are characterized by an exponential-like behavior.
In addition, it is important to notice that the exponential terms' coefficients are computed running a genetic-algorithm optimization
problem, which is quite slow in case of increasing number of ``numberExpTerms''.
%
In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be set equal to \xmlString{PolyExponential} (see the example
below).

%%%% ROM Model - DMD  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{DMD}
\label{subsubsec:polyexponential}
The DMD sub-type contains a single ROM type, aimed to construct a time-dependent (or any other monotonic
variable) surrogate model based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ref. \cite{Schmid2010DMD} and \cite{Vega2017HODMD}).
This surrogate is aimed to perform a ``dimensionality reduction regression'', where, given time series (or any monotonic-dependent
variable) of data, a set of modes each of which is associated with a fixed oscillation frequency and decay/growth rate is computed
in order to represent the data-set.
%
In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be set equal to \xmlString{DMD} (see the example
below).
%

     \item \textit{hodmd}, for high order DMD.
   \end{itemize}
   \default{dmd}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, defines the pivot variable (e.g., time) that represents the

  \item \xmlNode{rankSVD}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the truncation rank to be used for the SVD.
     Available options are:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item \textit{-1}, no truncation is performed
     \item \textit{0}, optimal rank is internally computed
     \item \textit{>1}, this rank is going to be used for the truncation
   \end{itemize}
   \default{-1}
  \item \xmlNode{energyRankSVD}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field},  energy level ($0.0 < float < 1.0$) used to compute the rank such
    as computed rank is the number of the biggest singular values needed to reach the energy identified by
    \xmlNode{energyRankSVD}. This node has always priority over  \xmlNode{rankSVD}
    \default{None}
  \item \xmlNode{rankTLSQ}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, $int > 0$ that defines the truncation rank to be used for the total
   least square problem. If not inputted, no truncation is applied
   \default{None}
   \item \xmlNode{exactModes}, \xmlDesc{bool, optional field}, True if the exact modes need to be computed (eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors),   otherwise the projected ones (using the left-singular matrix after SVD).
  \default{True}
  \item \xmlNode{optimized}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field}, True if the amplitudes need to be computed minimizing the error
   between the modes and all the time-steps or False, if only the 1st timestep only needs to be considered
   \default{True}

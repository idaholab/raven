{
  \item \xmlNode{Segment}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, provides an alternative way to build the ROM. When
    this mode is enabled, the subspace of the ROM (e.g. ``time'') will be divided into segments as
    requested, then a distinct ROM will be trained on each of the segments. This is especially helpful if
    during the subspace the ROM representation of the signal changes significantly. For example, if the signal
    is different during summer and winter, then a signal can be divided and a distinct ROM trained on the
    segments. By default, no segmentation occurs.

    To futher enable clustering of the segments, the \xmlNode{Segment} has the following attributes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlAttr{grouping}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field} enables the use of ROM subspace clustering in
        addition to segmenting if set to \xmlString{cluster}. If set to \xmlString{segment}, then performs
        segmentation without clustering. If clustering, then an additional node needs to be included in the
        \xmlNode{Segment} node, as described below.
        \default{segment}
    \end{itemize}

    This node takes the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{subspace}, \xmlDesc{string, required field} designates the subspace to divide. This
        should be the pivot parameter (often ``time'') for the ROM. This node also requires an attribute
        to determine how the subspace is divided, as well as other attributes, described below:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \xmlAttr{pivotLength}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field}, provides the value in the subspace
            that each segment should attempt to represent, independently of how the data is stored. For
            example, if the subspace has hourly resolution, is measured in seconds, and the desired
            segmentation is daily, the \xmlAttr{pivotLength} would be 86400.
            Either this option or \xmlAttr{divisions} must be provided.
          \item \xmlAttr{divisions}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, as an alternative to
            \xmlAttr{pivotLength}, this attribute can be used to specify how many data points to include in
            each subdivision, rather than use the pivot values. The algorithm will attempt to split the data
            points as equally as possible.
            Either this option or \xmlAttr{pivotLength} must be provided.
          \item \xmlAttr{shift}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, governs the way in which the subspace is
            treated in each segment. By default, the subspace retains its actual values for each segment; for
            example, if each segment is 4 hours long, the first segment starts at time 0, the second at 4
            hours, the third at 8 hours, and so forth. Options to change this behavior are \xmlString{zero}
            and \xmlString{first}. In the case of \xmlString{zero}, each segment restarts the pivot with the
            subspace value as 0, shifting all other values similarly. In the example above, the first segment
            would start at 0, the second at 0, and the third at 0, with each ending at 4 hours. Note that the
            pivot values are restored when the ROM is evaluated. Using \xmlString{first}, each segment
            subspace restarts at the value of the first segment. This is useful in the event subspace 0 is not
            a desirable value.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{Classifier}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field} associates a \xmlNode{PostProcessor}
        defined in the \xmlNode{Models} block to this segmentation. If clustering is enabled (see
        \xmlAttr{grouping} above), then this associated Classifier will be used to cluster the segmented ROM
        subspaces. The attributes \xmlAttr{class}=\xmlString{Models} and
        \xmlAttr{type}=\xmlString{PostProcessor} must be set, and the text of this node is the \xmlAttr{name}
        of the requested Classifier. Note this Classifier must be a valid Classifier; not all PostProcessors
        are suitable. For example, see the DataMining PostProcessor subtype Clustering.
      \item \xmlNode{clusterFeatures}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, if clustering then delineates
        the fundamental ROM features that should be considered while clustering. The available features are
        ROM-dependent, and an exception is raised if an unrecognized request is given. See individual ROMs
        for options. \default All ROM-specific options.
      \item \xmlNode{evalMode}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, one of \xmlString{truncated},
        \xmlString{full}, or \xmlString{clustered}, determines how the evaluations are
        represented, as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \xmlString{full}, reproduce the full signal using representative cluster segments,
          \item \xmlString{truncated}, reproduce a history containing exactly segment from each
            cluster placed back-to-back, with the \xmlNode{pivotParameter} spanning the clustered
            dimension. Note this will almost surely not be the same length as the original signal;
            information about indexing can be found in the ROM's XML metadata.
          \item \xmlString{clustered}, reproduce a N-dimensional object with the variable
            \texttt{\_ROM\_cluster} as one of the indexes for the ROM's sampled variables. Note that
            in order to use the option, the receiving \xmlNode{DataObject} should be of type
            \xmlNode{DataSet} with one of the indices being \texttt{\_ROM\_cluster}.
        \end{itemize}
     \item \xmlNode{evaluationClusterChoice}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, one of \xmlString{first} or
        \xmlString{random}, determines, if \xmlAttr{grouping}$=cluster$, which
        strategy needs to be followed for the evaluation stage. If ``first'', the
        first ROM (representative segmented ROM),in each cluster, is considered to
         be representative of the full space in the cluster (i.e. the evaluation is always performed
         interrogating the first ROM in each cluster); If ``random'', a random ROM, in each cluster,
         is choosen when an evaluation is requested.
	 \nb if ``first'' is used, there is \emph{substantial} memory savings when compared to using
	 ``random''.
         %If ``centroid'', a ROM ``trained" on the centroids
         %information of each cluster is used for the evaluation (\nb ``centroid'' option is not
         %available yet).

\subsection{ROM}
\label{subsec:models_ROM}
A Reduced Order Model (ROM) is a mathematical model consisting of a fast
solution trained to predict a response of interest of a physical system.
%
The ``training'' process is performed by sampling the response of a physical
model with respect to variations of its parameters subject, for example, to
probabilistic behavior.
%
The results (outcomes of the physical model) of the sampling are fed into the
algorithm representing the ROM that tunes itself to replicate those results.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of ROMs, both internally developed and
imported through an external library called ``scikit-learn''~\cite{SciKitLearn}.

Currently in RAVEN, the ROMs are classified into several sub-types that, once chosen,
provide access to several different algorithms.
%
\specBlock{a}{ROM}
%
\attrsIntro
%
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \nameDescription
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines which of
  the sub-types should be used, choosing among the previously reported
  types.
  %
  This choice conditions the subsequent the required and/or optional
  \xmlNode{ROM} sub-nodes.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

In the \xmlNode{ROM} input block, the following XML sub-nodes are required,
independent of the \xmlAttr{subType} specified:
%
\begin{itemize}
  %
   \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
     specifies the names of the features of this ROM.
   \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this object
    (see Section~\ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer});
    \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
      contains a comma separated list of the targets of this ROM. These parameters
      are the Figures of Merit (FOMs) this ROM is supposed to predict.
    \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this
    object (see Section \ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer}).
\end{itemize}

If a time-dependent ROM is requested, a \textbf{HistorySet} should be provided.
The temporal vairable specified in the \textbf{HistorySet} should be also listed
as sub-nodes inside \xmlNode{ROM}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, optional parameter}, specifies the pivot
    variable (e.g. time, etc) used in the input HistorySet.
    \default{time}
\end{itemize}
%
In addition, if the user wants to use the alias system, the following XML block can be inputted:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \aliasSystemDescription{ROM}
\end{itemize}


The types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes depend on the sub-type
specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.

%
Note that if an HistorySet is provided in the training step then a temporal ROM is created, i.e. a ROM that generates not a single value prediction of each element indicated in the  \xmlNode{Target} block but its full temporal profile.

\subsubsection{SerializePyomo}
\label{subsubsec:serializepyomo}
For the purpose of exporting RAVEN trained ROMs in an universal-accessible format for Pyomo to solve, the platform to prepare
the python syntax including the process to setup concrete models and constraints is created. The python syntax allows to
to retrieve pickled (serialized) ROMs and solve the defined concrete model via Pynumero's GreyBoxModel, an extension of Pyomo.
Details on how GreyBoxModel works can be found in the following site:

\begin{lstlisting}
  https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_packages/pynumero/index.html
\end{lstlisting}

Two files are required to run the optimization: the pickled rom and the generated python file. The workflow to create both files is
provided in the example below located at the end of this subsection. The following command line is the defined format to interface both files:

\begin{lstlisting}
  python3 printed_python_file.py -r rom_pickled_file.pk -f location_of_raven_framework -order order_of_derivative
\end{lstlisting}

The file names `printed\_python\_file', `rom\_pickled\_file', and `order\_of\_derivative' are arbitrary names, and are not requirements.
The `location\_of\_raven\_framework' is the relative path to where `raven\_framework' is located. The created python file includes modules from
RAVEN and is required dealing with derivatives for GreyBoxModel to solve. The rest of the command line syntax `-r', `-f', `-order' are place holders for
the python file to locate where the pickled ROMs and the python file itself are. Caution, make sure the `order\_of\_derivative' is an integer. If not provided,
the default value is 1. When running the command a text file named `GreyModelOutput\_cyipopt.txt' will be created showing the results of the optimization.

Since the code developed in ROMs is not a subtype, the code activation for python interface file print is triggered by adding the input subnode with type `Pyomo':

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,subType}]
  <Input name="rom_out.py" type="Pyomo">rom_out.py</Input>
\end{lstlisting}

To verify the output files in the given test file in:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,subType}]
  raven/tests/framework/Models/External/serialize_pyomo.xml
\end{lstlisting}

and the associated example optimization case:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,subType}]
  python3 rom_out.py -r rom_pickle.pk -f ../../../..
\end{lstlisting}

are runnable with GreyBoxModel, several optional RAVEN dependencies are required. The following are the required
optional libraries: `pyomo 6.4' or over, `cmake', `glpk', `ipopt', `cyipopt', and `pyomo-extensions'. Although almost all required
libraries are standard packages (available on conda or pipy install), the `pyomo-extensions' is a custom library created by RAVEN developers to install `Pynumero'.
It functions to run the following commands if `pyomo-extensions' is part of the RAVEN library installation:

\begin{lstlisting}
  pyomo download-extensions
  pyomo build-extensions
\end{lstlisting}

For this reason, libraries `Pyomo' and `cmake' are required for successful `Pynumero' installation. Note, although all RAVEN dependency installs will
be placed in the RAVEN library directory, the current `Pyomo' version saves extensions on the local python local directory.
Other libraries are optimization solvers for `Pyomo' and `Pynumero'. Make sure the RAVEN conda library is activated when testing the example cases.
The method to include optional RAVEN libraries is by adding the `optional' flag to the RAVEN library installation command:

\begin{lstlisting}
  cd raven
  ./scripts/establish_conda_env.sh --install --optional='pyomo cmake ipopt cyipopt pyomo-extensions'
\end{lstlisting}

If the user plans to run the optimization case outside of RAVEN libraries and the pickled ROM has already been generated, instead install `pyomo', `cmake',
`glpk', `ipopt', and `cyipopt' to your system. After this is done, on a terminal, run the `Pyomo' download and extension command introduced earlier.
This will install `Pynumero' to your system.

If the user plans to use the RAVEN library, it is recommended to activate RAVEN libraries using the following command
on the terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}
  source scripts/establish_conda_env.sh --load
\end{lstlisting}

Make sure that the optional libraries are installed before running the pickled ROM and printed python file. Regardless of whether `Pynumero' is
installed inside or outside RAVEN libraries, depending on the OS, C++ libraries may be outdated for `Pynumero' to run. It has been reported that
the following OS has failed to run `Pynumero':

\begin{itemize}
  \item CentOS 7, 8
  \item Ubuntu 16, 18
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} For this example the external model is trained and further loaded as `out\_rom'. The loaded trained model is separately
processed to `rom\_out.py' and `rom\_pickle.pk'.

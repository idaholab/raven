{
  \item \xmlNode{Segment}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, provides an alternative way to build the ROM. When
    this mode is enabled, the subspace of the ROM (e.g. ``time'') will be divided into segments as
    requested, then a distinct ROM will be trained on each of the segments. This is especially helpful if
    during the subspace the ROM representation of the signal changes significantly. For example, if the signal
    is different during summer and winter, then a signal can be divided and a distinct ROM trained on the
    segments. By default, no segmentation occurs.

    To futher enable clustering of the segments, the \xmlNode{Segment} has the following attributes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlAttr{grouping}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field} enables the use of ROM subspace clustering in
        addition to segmenting if set to \xmlString{cluster}. If set to \xmlString{segment}, then performs
        segmentation without clustering. If clustering, then an additional node needs to be included in the
        \xmlNode{Segment} node, as described below.
        \default{segment}
    \end{itemize}

    This node takes the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{subspace}, \xmlDesc{string, required field} designates the subspace to divide. This
        should be the pivot parameter (often ``time'') for the ROM. This node also requires an attribute
        to determine how the subspace is divided, as well as other attributes, described below:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \xmlAttr{pivotLength}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field}, provides the value in the subspace
            that each segment should attempt to represent, independently of how the data is stored. For
            example, if the subspace has hourly resolution, is measured in seconds, and the desired
            segmentation is daily, the \xmlAttr{pivotLength} would be 86400.
            Either this option or \xmlAttr{divisions} must be provided.
          \item \xmlAttr{divisions}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, as an alternative to
            \xmlAttr{pivotLength}, this attribute can be used to specify how many data points to include in
            each subdivision, rather than use the pivot values. The algorithm will attempt to split the data
            points as equally as possible.
            Either this option or \xmlAttr{pivotLength} must be provided.
          \item \xmlAttr{shift}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, governs the way in which the subspace is
            treated in each segment. By default, the subspace retains its actual values for each segment; for
            example, if each segment is 4 hours long, the first segment starts at time 0, the second at 4
            hours, the third at 8 hours, and so forth. Options to change this behavior are \xmlString{zero}
            and \xmlString{first}. In the case of \xmlString{zero}, each segment restarts the pivot with the
            subspace value as 0, shifting all other values similarly. In the example above, the first segment
            would start at 0, the second at 0, and the third at 0, with each ending at 4 hours. Note that the
            pivot values are restored when the ROM is evaluated. Using \xmlString{first}, each segment
            subspace restarts at the value of the first segment. This is useful in the event subspace 0 is not
            a desirable value.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{Classifier}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field} associates a \xmlNode{PostProcessor}
        defined in the \xmlNode{Models} block to this segmentation. If clustering is enabled (see
        \xmlAttr{grouping} above), then this associated Classifier will be used to cluster the segmented ROM
        subspaces. The attributes \xmlAttr{class}=\xmlString{Models} and
        \xmlAttr{type}=\xmlString{PostProcessor} must be set, and the text of this node is the \xmlAttr{name}
        of the requested Classifier. Note this Classifier must be a valid Classifier; not all PostProcessors
        are suitable. For example, see the DataMining PostProcessor subtype Clustering.
      \item \xmlNode{clusterFeatures}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, if clustering then delineates
        the fundamental ROM features that should be considered while clustering. The available features are
        ROM-dependent, and an exception is raised if an unrecognized request is given. See individual ROMs
        for options. \default All ROM-specific options.
      \item \xmlNode{evalMode}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, one of \xmlString{truncated},
        \xmlString{full}, or \xmlString{clustered}, determines how the evaluations are
        represented, as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \xmlString{full}, reproduce the full signal using representative cluster segments,
          \item \xmlString{truncated}, reproduce a history containing exactly segment from each
            cluster placed back-to-back, with the \xmlNode{pivotParameter} spanning the clustered
            dimension. Note this will almost surely not be the same length as the original signal;
            information about indexing can be found in the ROM's XML metadata.
          \item \xmlString{clustered}, reproduce a N-dimensional object with the variable
            \texttt{\_ROM\_cluster} as one of the indexes for the ROM's sampled variables. Note that
            in order to use the option, the receiving \xmlNode{DataObject} should be of type
            \xmlNode{DataSet} with one of the indices being \texttt{\_ROM\_cluster}.
        \end{itemize}
     \item \xmlNode{evaluationClusterChoice}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, one of \xmlString{first} or
        \xmlString{random}, determines, if \xmlAttr{grouping}$=cluster$, which
        strategy needs to be followed for the evaluation stage. If ``first'', the
        first ROM (representative segmented ROM),in each cluster, is considered to
         be representative of the full space in the cluster (i.e. the evaluation is always performed
         interrogating the first ROM in each cluster); If ``random'', a random ROM, in each cluster,
         is choosen when an evaluation is requested.
	 \nb if ``first'' is used, there is \emph{substantial} memory savings when compared to using
	 ``random''.
         %If ``centroid'', a ROM ``trained" on the centroids
         %information of each cluster is used for the evaluation (\nb ``centroid'' option is not
         %available yet).
         \default{first}

\subsection{ROM}
\label{subsec:models_ROM}
A Reduced Order Model (ROM) is a mathematical model consisting of a fast
solution trained to predict a response of interest of a physical system.
%
The ``training'' process is performed by sampling the response of a physical
model with respect to variations of its parameters subject, for example, to
probabilistic behavior.
%
The results (outcomes of the physical model) of the sampling are fed into the
algorithm representing the ROM that tunes itself to replicate those results.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of ROMs, both internally developed and
imported through an external library called ``scikit-learn''~\cite{SciKitLearn}.

Currently in RAVEN, the ROMs are classified into several sub-types that, once chosen,
provide access to several different algorithms.
%
\specBlock{a}{ROM}
%
\attrsIntro
%
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \nameDescription
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines which of
  the sub-types should be used, choosing among the previously reported
  types.
  %
  This choice conditions the subsequent the required and/or optional
  \xmlNode{ROM} sub-nodes.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

In the \xmlNode{ROM} input block, the following XML sub-nodes are required,
independent of the \xmlAttr{subType} specified:
%
\begin{itemize}
  %
   \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
     specifies the names of the features of this ROM.
   \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this object
    (see Section~\ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer});
    \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
      contains a comma separated list of the targets of this ROM. These parameters
      are the Figures of Merit (FOMs) this ROM is supposed to predict.
    \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this
    object (see Section \ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer}).
\end{itemize}

If a time-dependent ROM is requested, a \textbf{HistorySet} should be provided.
The temporal vairable specified in the \textbf{HistorySet} should be also listed
as sub-nodes inside \xmlNode{ROM}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, optional parameter}, specifies the pivot
    variable (e.g. time, etc) used in the input HistorySet.
    \default{time}
\end{itemize}
%
In addition, if the user wants to use the alias system, the following XML block can be inputted:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \aliasSystemDescription{ROM}
\end{itemize}


The types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes depend on the sub-type
specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.

%
Note that if an HistorySet is provided in the training step then a temporal ROM is created, i.e. a ROM that generates not a single value prediction of each element indicated in the  \xmlNode{Target} block but its full temporal profile.

Reduced Order Models (e.g. most of the SciKitLearn-based ROMs):}}
\begin{equation}
  \mathit{\mathbf{X'}} = \frac{(\mathit{\mathbf{X}}-\mu )}{\sigma }
\end{equation}
\\In the following sections the specifications of each ROM type are reported, highlighting when a \textbf{Z-score normalization} is performed by RAVEN before constructing the ROM or when it is not performed.

%%%% ROM Model - DMDC  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{DMDC}
\label{subsubsec:polyexponential}
The DMDC sub-type contains a single ROM type similar to DMD, aimed to construct a time-dependent surrogate model based on Dynamic 
Mode Decomposition with Control (ref. \cite{proctor2016dynamic}).
In addition to perform a ``dimensionality reduction regression'' like DMD, this surrogate will calculate the state-space 
representation matrices A, B and  C in a discrete time domain. 

\begin{itemize}
\item x[k+1]=A*x[k]+B*u[k]
\item y[k+1]=C*x[k+1] 
\end{itemize}

%
In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be set equal to \xmlString{DMDC} (see the example
below).
%
\subnodeIntro

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{dmdType}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, the type of Dynamic 
  Mode Decomposition to apply. Available are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{dmd}, for classical DMD
    \end{itemize}
  \default{dmd}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, defines the pivot 
  variable (e.g., time) that represents the
  independent monotonic variable
  \default{time}
  
  \item \xmlNode{StateVariables}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},  
  defines the state variables (i.e. system variable vectors)
  of this model. Each state variable (x1, x2, etc.) needs to be listed here. The variables 
  indicated in \xmlNode{StateVariables} must be listed in the 
   \xmlNode{Target} node too.
  
  \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines 
  output FOMs that are going to be predicted.
  The pivot variable in \xmlNode{pivotParameter} and the \xmlNode{StateVariables} 
  variables must be listed in this node too. In addition, each system output variables 
  (e.g. y1, y2, etc.) must be listed.
    
  \item \xmlNode{InitStateVariables},  \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required 
  field},  defines the state variables' ids  that should be used as initialization variable
  in the evaluation stage (for the evaluation of the model). These variables are used
  for the first time step to initiate the rolling time-step prediction of the state variables,
  ``exited'' by the \xmlNode{Actuators} signal. The variables listed in 
  \xmlNode{InitStateVariables} must be listed in the  \xmlNode{Features} node too.
  
  \item \xmlNode{Actuators}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, 
  defines the actuators (i.e. system input parameters)
  of this model. Each actuator variables (u1, u2, etc.) needs to be listed here.
  
  \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines 
  the features (i.e. system input and state 
  parameters) of this model. The variables in \xmlNode{Actuators},  each system state 
  variable \xmlNode{StateVariables} (x1, x2, etc.), and the initialization state variables  
  \xmlNode{InitStateVariables} are required in \xmlNode{Features}. In addition to those
  variables, a list of variables that can be use to ``parametrize'' the surrogate model 
  can be listed (flow\_rate, power, etc.). Those ``parameterization'' parameters can 
  come, for example, from a RAVEN sampling strategies (e.g. uncertanties).
  
  \item \xmlNode{rankSVD}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the truncation rank to be used for the SVD.
     Available options are:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item \textit{$-1$}, no truncation is performed
     \item \textit{$0$}, optimal rank is internally computed
     \item \textit{$>1$}, this rank is going to be used for the truncation
   \end{itemize}
   \default{-1}
  \item \xmlNode{SubtractNormUXY}, \xmlDesc{bool, optional field}, True if the initial values need to be subtracted from the 
  actuators (u), state (x) and outputs (y) if any. False if the subtraction is not needed.
    \default{False}

\end{itemize}

Once the ROM  is trained (\textbf{Step} \xmlNode{RomTrainer}), its parameters/coefficients can be exported into an XML file
via an \xmlNode{OutStream} of type \xmlAttr{Print}. The following variable/parameters can be exported (i.e. \xmlNode{what} node
in \xmlNode{OutStream} of type \xmlAttr{Print}):
\begin{itemize}

  \item \xmlNode{acturators}, see XML input specifications above
  \item \xmlNode{UNorm}, XML node containing the norminal values of actuators, which are the initial values in the training data
  \item \xmlNode{states}, XML node containing the list of system state variables (x)
  \item \xmlNode{initStates}, XML node containing the list of system state variables 
  (x\_init) that are used for initializing the model in ``evaluation'' mode.
  \item \xmlNode{XNorm}, XML node containing the norminal values of state variables, which are the initial values in the training data
  \item \xmlNode{XLast}, XML node containing the last value of state variables, which are the final values in the training data

  \item \xmlNode{Ctilde}, XML node containing the C matrix in discrete time domain (real and imaginary and part, matrix shape, and format note)
\end{itemize}

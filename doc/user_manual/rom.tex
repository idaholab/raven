\subsection{ROM}
\label{subsec:models_ROM}
A Reduced Order Model (ROM) is a mathematical model consisting of a fast
solution trained to predict a response of interest of a physical system.
%
The ``training'' process is performed by sampling the response of a physical
model with respect to variations of its parameters subject, for example, to
probabilistic behavior.
%
The results (outcomes of the physical model) of the sampling are fed into the
algorithm representing the ROM that tunes itself to replicate those results.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of ROMs, both internally developed and
imported through an external library called ``scikit-learn''~\cite{SciKitLearn}.

Currently in RAVEN, the ROMs are classified into several sub-types that, once chosen,
provide access to several different algorithms.
%
These sub-types are specified in the \xmlAttr{subType} attribute and should be
one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlString{GaussPolynomialRom}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{HDMRRom}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{NDinvDistWeight}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{NDSpline}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{SciKitLearn}, for both static and time-dependent regression and classification
  \item \xmlString{MSR}, for both static and time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{ARMA}, for time-dependent stochastic regression (time series generator)
  \item \xmlString{PolyExponential}, for time-dependent regression
  \item \xmlString{DMD}, for time-dependent regression
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \nameDescription
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines which of
  the sub-types should be used, choosing among the previously reported
  types.
  %
  This choice conditions the subsequent the required and/or optional
  \xmlNode{ROM} sub-nodes.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

In the \xmlNode{ROM} input block, the following XML sub-nodes are required,
independent of the \xmlAttr{subType} specified:
%
\begin{itemize}
  %
   \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
     specifies the names of the features of this ROM.
   \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this object
    (see Section~\ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer});
    \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
      contains a comma separated list of the targets of this ROM. These parameters
      are the Figures of Merit (FOMs) this ROM is supposed to predict.
    \nb These parameters are going to be requested for the training of this
    object (see Section \ref{subsec:stepRomTrainer}).
\end{itemize}

If a time-dependent ROM is requested, a \textbf{HistorySet} should be provided.
The temporal vairable specified in the \textbf{HistorySet} should be also listed
as sub-nodes inside \xmlNode{ROM}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, optional parameter}, specifies the pivot
    variable (e.g. time, etc) used in the input HistorySet.
    \default{time}
\end{itemize}
%
In addition, if the user wants to use the alias system, the following XML block can be inputted:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \aliasSystemDescription{ROM}
\end{itemize}


The types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes depend on the sub-type
specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.

%
Note that if an HistorySet is provided in the training step then a temporal ROM is created, i.e. a ROM that generates not a single value prediction of each element indicated in the  \xmlNode{Target} block but its full temporal profile.

%%%%% ROM Model - NDspline  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{NDspline}
\label{subsubsec:NDspline}
The NDspline sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on an $N$-dimensional
spline interpolation/extrapolation scheme.
%
In spline interpolation, the regressor is a special type of piece-wise
polynomial called tensor spline.
%
The interpolation error can be made small even when using low degree polynomials
for the spline.
%
Spline interpolation avoids the problem of Runge's phenomenon, in which
oscillation can occur between points when interpolating using higher degree
polynomials.
%

In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{NDspline} (see the example below).
%
No further XML sub-nodes are required.
%
\nb This ROM type must be trained from a regular Cartesian grid.
%
Thus, it can only be trained from the outcomes of a grid sampling strategy.

%%%%% ROM Model - GaussPolynomialRom  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{pickledROM}
\label{subsubsec:pickledROM}
It is not uncommon for a reduced-order model (ROM) to be created and trained in one RAVEN run, then
serialized to file (\emph{pickled}), then loaded into another RAVEN run to be used as a model.  When this is
the case, a \xmlNode{ROM} with subtype \xmlString{pickledROM} is used to hold the place of the ROM that will
be loaded from file.  The notation for this ROM is much less than a typical ROM; it only requires a name and
its subtype.

Note that when loading ROMs from file, RAVEN will not perform any checks on the expected inputs or outputs of
a ROM; it is expected that a user know at least the I/O of a ROM before trying to use it as a model.
However, RAVEN does require that pickled ROMs be trained before pickling in the first place.

Initially, a pickledROM is not usable.  It cannot be trained or sampled; attempting to do so will raise an
error.  An \xmlNode{IOStep} is used to load the ROM from file, at which point the ROM will have all the same
characteristics as when it was pickled in a previous RAVEN run.

\textbf{Example:}
For this example the ROM has already been created and trained in another RAVEN run, then pickled to a file
called \texttt{rom\_pickle.pk}.  In the example, the file is identified in \xmlNode{Files}, the model is
defined in \xmlNode{Models}, and the model loaded in \xmlNode{Steps}.

\subsubsection{GaussPolynomialRom}
\label{subsubsec:GaussPolynomialRom}
The GaussPolynomialRom sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on a
characteristic Gaussian polynomial fitting scheme: generalized polynomial chaos
expansion (gPC).
%
In gPC, sets of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the distribution of uncertainty
are used to represent the original model.  The method converges moments of the original
model faster than Monte Carlo for small-dimension uncertainty spaces ($N<15$).
%
In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{GaussPolynomialRom} (see the example below).
%
The GaussPolynomialRom is dependent on specific sampling; thus, this ROM cannot be trained unless a
SparseGridCollocation or similar Sampler specifies this ROM in its input and is sampled in a MultiRun step.
%
In addition to the common \xmlNode{Target} and \xmlNode{Features}, this ROM requires
two more nodes and can accept multiple entries of a third optional node.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{IndexSet}, \xmlDesc{string, required field},
  specifies the rules by which to construct multidimensional polynomials.  The options are
  \xmlString{TensorProduct}, \xmlString{TotalDegree},\\
  \xmlString{HyperbolicCross}, and \xmlString{Custom}.
  %
  Total degree is efficient for
  uncertain inputs with a large degree of regularity, while hyperbolic cross is more efficient
  for low-regularity input spaces.
  %
  If \xmlString{Custom} is chosen, the \xmlNode{IndexPoints} is required.
  %
  \item \xmlNode{PolynomialOrder}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field},
  indicates the maximum polynomial order in any one dimension to use in the
  polynomial chaos expansion. \nb If non-equal importance weights are supplied in the optional
  \xmlNode{Interpolation} node, the actual polynomial order in dimensions with high
  importance might exceed this value; however, this value is still used to limit the
  relative overall order.
  %
  \item \xmlNode{SparseGrid},\xmlDesc{string, optional field}, allows specification of the multidimensional
    quadrature construction strategy.  Options are \xmlString{smolyak} and \xmlString{tensor}.  Default is
    \xmlString{smolyak}.
  \item \xmlNode{IndexPoints}, \xmlDesc{list of tuples, required field},
  used to specify the index set points in a \xmlString{Custom} index set.  The tuples are
  entered as comma-seprated values between parenthesis, with each tuple separated by a comma.
  Any amount of whitespace is acceptable.  For example, \xmlNode{IndexPoints}\verb'(0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(4,0)'\xmlNode{/IndexPoints}
  \nb{Using custom index sets
  does not guarantee accurate convergence.}
  %
  \item \xmlNode{Interpolation}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field},
  offers the option to specify quadrature, polynomials, and importance weights for the given
  variable name.  The ROM accepts any number of \xmlNode{Interpolation} nodes up to the
  dimensionality of the input space.  This node accepts several attributes, all of which are
  optional and default to
  the code-defined optimal choices based on the input dimension uncertainty distribution:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlAttr{quad}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field},
      specifies the quadrature type to use for collocation in this dimension.  The default options
      depend on the uncertainty distribution of the input dimension, as shown in Table
      \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}. Additionally, Clenshaw Curtis quadrature can be used for any
      distribution that doesn't include an infinite bound.
      \default{see Table \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}.}
      \nb For an uncertain distribution aside from the four listed on Table
      \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}, this ROM
      makes use of the uniform-like range of the distribution's CDF to apply quadrature that is
      suited uniform uncertainty (Legendre).  It converges more slowly than the four listed, but are
      viable choices.  Choosing polynomial type Legendre for any non-uniform distribution will
      enable this formulation automatically.
    \item \xmlAttr{poly}, \xmlDesc{string,optional field},
      specifies the interpolating polynomial family to use for the polynomial expansion in this
      dimension.  The default options depend on the quadrature type chosen, as shown in Table
      \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}.  Currently, no polynomials are available outside the
      default. \default{see Table \ref{tab:gpcCompatible}.}
    \item  \xmlAttr{weight}, \xmlDesc{float, optional field},
      delineates the importance weighting of this dimension.  A larger importance weight will
      result in increased resolution for this dimension at the cost of resolution in lower-weighted
      dimensions.  The algorithm normalizes weights at run-time.\default{1}.

Thus, it can only be trained from the outcomes of a SparseGridCollocation sampler.
Also, this ROM must be referenced in the SparseGridCollocation sampler in order to
accurately produce the necessary sparse grid points to train this ROM.

    listed by each polynomial combination, with the polynomial order tags listed in the order of the variables
    shown in the XML print.
\end{itemize}

%%%%% ROM Model - HDMRRom  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{HDMRRom}
\label{subsubsec:HDMRRom}
The HDMRRom sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on a Sobol decomposition scheme.
%
In Sobol decomposition, also known as high-density model reduction (HDMR, specifically Cut-HDMR),
a model is approximated as as the sum of increasing-complexity interactions.  At its lowest level (order 1), it treats the function as a sum of the reference case plus a functional of each input dimesion separately.  At order 2, it adds functionals to consider the pairing of each dimension with each other dimension.  The benefit to this approach is considering several functions of small input cardinality instead of a single function with large input cardinality.  This allows reduced order models like generalized polynomial chaos (see \ref{subsubsec:GaussPolynomialRom}) to approximate the functionals accurately with few computations runs.
%
In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{HDMRRom} (see the example below).
%
The HDMRRom is dependent on specific sampling; thus, this ROM cannot be trained unless a
Sobol or similar Sampler specifies this ROM in its input and is sampled in a MultiRun step.
%
In addition to the common \xmlNode{Target} and \xmlNode{Features}, this ROM requires
the same nodes as the GaussPolynomialRom (see \ref{subsubsec:GaussPolynomialRom}.
Additionally, this ROM requires the \xmlNode{SobolOrder} node.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{SobolOrder}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field},
  indicates the maximum cardinality of the input space used in the subset functionals.  For example, order 1
  includes only functionals of each independent dimension separately, while order 2 considers pair-wise
  interactions.
  %
\end{itemize}
\nb This ROM type must be trained from a Sobol decomposition training set.
%
Thus, it can only be trained from the outcomes of a Sobol sampler.
Also, this ROM must be referenced in the Sobol sampler in order to
accurately produce the necessary sparse grid points to train this ROM.
Experience has shown order 2 Sobol decompositions to include the great majority of
  uncertainty in most models.

%%%%% ROM Model - MSR  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{MSR}
\label{subsubsec:MSR}
The MSR sub-type contains a class of ROMs that perform a topological
decomposition of the data into approximately monotonic regions and fits weighted
linear patches to the identified monotonic regions of the input space. Query
points have estimated probabilities that they belong to each cluster. These
probabilities can eitehr be used to give a smooth, weighted prediction based on
the associated linear models, or a hard classification to a particular local
linear model which is then used for prediction. Currently, the probability
prediction can be done using kernel density estimation (KDE) or through a
one-versus-one support vector machine (SVM).

In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to

The LinearModels' algorithms implement generalized linear models.
%
They include Ridge regression, Bayesian regression, lasso, and elastic net
estimators computed with least angle regression and coordinate descent.

\subparagraph{Linear Model: Automatic Relevance Determination Regression}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Automatic Relevance Determination} (ARD) regressor is a
hierarchical Bayesian approach where hyperparameters explicitly represent the
relevance of different input features.
%
These relevance hyperparameters determine the range of variation for the
parameters relating to a particular input, usually by modelling the width of a
zero-mean Gaussian prior on those parameters.
%
If the width of the Gaussian is zero, then those parameters are constrained to
be zero, and the corresponding input cannot have any effect on the predictions,
therefore making it irrelevant.
%
ARD optimizes these hyperparameters to discover which inputs are relevant.

\subparagraph{Linear Model: Bayesian ridge regression}
\mbox{}

The \textit{Bayesian ridge regression} estimates a probabilistic model of the
regression problem as described above.
%
The prior for the parameter $w$ is given by a spherical Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
p(w|\lambda) =\mathcal{N}(w|0,\lambda^{-1}\bold{I_{p}})
\end{equation}
The priors over $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are chosen to be gamma distributions, the
conjugate prior for the precision of the Gaussian.
%
The resulting model is called Bayesian ridge regression, and is similar to the
classical ridge regression.
%
The parameters $w$, $\alpha$, and $\lambda$ are estimated jointly during the fit
of the model.
%
The remaining hyperparameters are the parameters of the gamma priors over
$\alpha$ and $\lambda$.
%
These are usually chosen to be non-informative.
%
The parameters are estimated by maximizing the marginal log likelihood.

\mbox{}

The \textit{Linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, a.o.) with SGD
training} implements regularized linear models with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) learning: the gradient of the loss is estimated for each sample at
a time and the model is updated along the way with a decreasing strength
schedule (aka learning rate).
%
SGD allows minibatch (online/out-of-core) learning, see the partial\_fit method.
%
This implementation works with data represented as dense or sparse arrays of
floating point values for the features.
%
The model it fits can be controlled with the loss parameter; by default, it fits
a linear support vector machine (SVM).
%
The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model
parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared Euclidean norm L2 or
the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net).
%
If the parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the
update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieves
online feature selection.

%%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Support Vector Machines %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Support Vector Machines}
\label{SVM}
In machine learning, \textbf{Support Vector Machines} (SVMs, also support vector
networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms
that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression
analysis.
%
Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two
categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples
into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear
classifier.
%
An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so
that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is
as wide as possible.
%
New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a
category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
%
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a
non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly
mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

as one-vs-all, consists in fitting one classifier per class.
%
For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes.
%
In addition to its computational efficiency (only n\_classes classifiers are
needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability.
%
Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible
to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier.
%
This is the most commonly used strategy and is a fair default choice.

\subparagraph{One-vs-one multiclass strategy}
\mbox{}

The \textit{One-vs-one multiclass strategy} consists in fitting one classifier
per class pair.
%
At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected.
%
Since it requires to fit n\_classes * (n\_classes - 1) / 2 classifiers, this
method is usually slower than one-vs-the-rest, due to its O(n\_classes$^2$)
complexity.
%
However, this method may be advantageous for algorithms such as kernel
algorithms which do not scale well with n\_samples.
%
This is because each individual learning problem only involves a small subset of
the data whereas, with one-vs-the-rest, the complete dataset is used n\_classes
times.

%
At fitting time, one binary classifier per bit in the code book is fitted.
%
At prediction time, the classifiers are used to project new points in the class
space and the class closest to the points is chosen.
%
The main advantage of these strategies is that the number of classifiers used
can be controlled by the user, either for compressing the model ($0 < code\_
size < 1$) or for making the model more robust to errors ($code\_ size > 1$).

\paragraph{Naive Bayes}
\label{naiveBayes}
Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on
applying Bayes' theorem with the ``naive'' assumption of independence between
every pair of features.
%
Given a class variable y and a dependent feature vector x\_1 through x\_n,
Bayes' theorem states the following relationship:
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{P(y) P(x_1, \dots x_n \mid y)}
{P(x_1, \dots, x_n)}
\end{equation}
Using the naive independence assumption that
\begin{equation}
P(x_i | y, x_1, \dots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_n) = P(x_i | y),
\end{equation}
for all i, this relationship is simplified to
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y)}
{P(x_1, \dots, x_n)}
\end{equation}
Since $P(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is constant given the input, we can use the following
classification rule:
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) \propto P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y)
\Downarrow
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \arg\max_y P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y),
\end{equation}
and we can use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate $P(y)$ and
$P(x_i \mid y)$; the former is then the relative frequency of class $y$ in the
training set.
%
The different naive Bayes classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make
regarding the distribution of $P(x_i \mid y)$.

In spite of their apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes
classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously
document classification and spam filtering.
%
They require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary
parameters.
%
(For theoretical reasons why naive Bayes works well, and on which types of data
it does, see the references below.)
Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more
sophisticated methods.
%
The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each
distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution.
%
This in turn helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of
dimensionality.

On the flip side, although naive Bayes is known as a decent classifier, it is
known to be a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict\_proba are
not to be taken too seriously.
%
In the following, all the Naive Bayes available in RAVEN are reported.
%
%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{Gaussian Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Gaussian Naive Bayes strategy} implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes
algorithm for classification.
%
The likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
P(x_i \mid y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_y}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x_i -
  \mu_y)^2}{2\sigma^2_y}\right)
\end{equation}
The parameters $\sigma_y$ and $\mu_y$ are estimated using maximum likelihood.

In order to use the \textit{Gaussian Naive Bayes strategy}, the user needs to
set the sub-node:

\xmlNode{SKLtype}\texttt{naiveBayes|GaussianNB}\xmlNode{/SKLtype}.

There are no additional sub-nodes available for this method.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{Multinomial Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Multinomial Naive Bayes} implements the naive Bayes algorithm for
multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes
variants used in text classification (where the data is typically represented
as word vector counts, although tf-idf vectors are also known to work well in
practice).
%
The distribution is parametrized by vectors $\theta_y =
(\theta_{y1},\ldots,\theta_{yn})$ for each class $y$, where $n$ is the number of
features (in text classification, the size of the vocabulary) and $\theta_{yi}$
is the probability $P(x_i \mid y)$ of feature $i$ appearing in a sample
belonging to class $y$.
%
The parameters $\theta_y$ are estimated by a smoothed version of maximum
likelihood, i.e. relative frequency counting:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}_{yi} = \frac{ N_{yi} + \alpha}{N_y + \alpha n}
\end{equation}
where $N_{yi} = \sum_{x \in T} x_i$ is the number of times feature $i$ appears
in a sample of class y in the training set T, and
$N_{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{|T|} N_{yi}$ is the total count of all features for class
$y$.
%
The smoothing priors $\alpha \ge 0$ account for features not present in the
learning samples and prevents zero probabilities in further computations.
%
Setting $\alpha = 1$ is called Laplace smoothing, while $\alpha < 1$ is called
Lidstone smoothing.

\subparagraph{Bernoulli Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Bernoulli Naive Bayes} implements the naive Bayes training and
classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate
Bernoulli distributions; i.e., there may be multiple features but each one is
assumed to be a binary-valued (Bernoulli, boolean) variable.
%
Therefore, this class requires samples to be represented as binary-valued
feature vectors; if handed any other kind of data, a \textit{Bernoulli Naive
Bayes} instance may binarize its input (depending on the binarize parameter).
%
The decision rule for Bernoulli naive Bayes is based on
\begin{equation}
P(x_i \mid y) = P(i \mid y) x_i + (1 - P(i \mid y)) (1 - x_i)
\end{equation}
which differs from multinomial NB's rule in that it explicitly penalizes the
non-occurrence of a feature $i$ that is an indicator for class $y$, where the
multinomial variant would simply ignore a non-occurring feature.
%
In the case of text classification, word occurrence vectors (rather than word
count vectors) may be used to train and use this classifier.
%
\textit{Bernoulli Naive Bayes} might perform better on some datasets, especially
those with shorter documents.
%
It is advisable to evaluate both models, if time permits.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Neighbors %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Neighbors}
\label{Neighbors}

The \textit{Neighbors} class provides functionality for unsupervised and
supervised neighbor-based learning methods.
%
The unsupervised nearest neighbors method is the foundation of many other
learning methods, notably manifold learning and spectral clustering.
%
Supervised neighbors-based learning comes in two flavors: classification for
data with discrete labels, and regression for data with continuous labels.

The principle behind nearest neighbor methods is to find a predefined number of
training samples closest in distance to the new point, and predict the label
from these.
%
The number of samples can be a user-defined constant (k-nearest neighbor
learning), or vary based on the local density of points (radius-based neighbor
learning).
%
The distance can, in general, be any metric measure: standard Euclidean distance
is the most common choice.
%
Neighbor-based methods are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods,
since they simply ``remember'' all of its training data (possibly transformed
into a fast indexing structure such as a Ball Tree or KD Tree.).

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Tree %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Tree}
\label{tree}

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for
classification and regression.
%
The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by
learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some advantages of decision trees are:
  \item Simple to understand and to interpret.
  %
  Trees can be visualized.
  %
  \item Requires little data preparation.
  %
  Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be
  created and blank values to be removed.
  %
  Note however, that this module does not support missing values.
  %
  \item The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the
  number of data points used to train the tree.
  %
  \item Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.
  %
  Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that have only
  one type of variable.
  %
  \item Able to handle multi-output problems.
  %
  \item Uses a white box model.
  %
  If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the
  condition is easily explained by boolean logic.
  %
  By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network),
  results may be more difficult to interpret.
  %
  \item Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.
  %
  That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.
  %
  \item Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true
  model from which the data were generated.
  %
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of decision trees include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not
  generalise the data well.
  %
  This is called overfitting.
  %
  Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum
  number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the
  tree are necessary to avoid this problem.
  %
  \item Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data
  might result in a completely different tree being generated.
  %
  This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.
  %
  \item The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be
  NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts.
  %
  Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on
  heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal
  decisions are made at each node.
  %
  Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree.
  %
  This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where
  the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.
  %
  \item There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not
  express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.
  %
  \item Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.
  %
  It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the
  decision tree.

\paragraph{Gaussian Process}
\label{GP}
Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML) is a generic supervised learning
method primarily designed to solve regression problems.
%
The advantages of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prediction interpolates the observations (at least for regular
  correlation models).
  \item The prediction is probabilistic (Gaussian) so that one can compute
  empirical confidence intervals and exceedance probabilities that might be used
  to refit (online fitting, adaptive fitting) the prediction in some region of
  interest.
  \item Versatile: different linear regression models and correlation models can
  be specified.
  %
  Common models are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom models
  provided they are stationary.
  %
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is not sparse.
  %
  It uses the whole samples/features information to perform the prediction.
  \item It loses efficiency in high dimensional spaces – namely when the
  number of features exceeds a few dozens.
  %
  It might indeed give poor performance and it loses computational efficiency.
  \item Classification is only a post-processing, meaning that one first needs
  to solve a regression problem by providing the complete scalar float precision
  output $y$ of the experiment one is attempting to model.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Neural Network Models %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Neural Network Models}
\label{DNN}
It has been more than 70 years since Warren McCulloch and Water Pitts modeled the first
artificial neural network (ANN) that mimicked the way brains work. These days, deep learning
based on ANN is showing outstanding results for solving a wide variety of robotic tasks in
the areas of perception, planning, localization, and control.
%
\textbf{Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)} is a supervised learning algorithm that can learn
a non-linear function approximator for either classifcation or regression. It is different
from logistic regression, in that between the input and output layer, there can be one
or more non-linear layers, called hidden layers.
%
The advantages of Multi-layer Perceptron are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Capability to learn non-linear models
  \item Capability to learn models in real-time (online learning)
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of Multi-layer Perceptron include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MLP with hidden layers have a non-convex loss function where there exists more than
    one local minimum. Therefore different random weight initializations can lead to different
    validation accuracy.
  \item MLP requires tuning a number of hyperparameters such as the number of hidden neurons, layers
    and iterations.
  \item MLP is sensitive to feature scaling
\end{itemize}

In the following, Multi-layer perceptron classification and regression algorithms available in RAVEN are reported.

\subparagraph{MLPClassifier}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{MLPClassifier} implements a multi-layer perceptron algorithm that trains using \textbf{Backpropagation}
More precisely, it trains using some form of gradient descent and the gradients are calculated using Backpropagation.
For classification, it minimizes the Cross-Entropy loss function, and it supports multi-class classification.

\\The \textit{MLPRegressor} implements a multi-layer perceptron algorithm that trains using \textbf{Backpropagation} with
no activation function in the output layer, which can also be seen as using the identity function as activation function.
Therefore, it uses the square error as the loss function, and the output is a set of continuous values.
\textit{MLPRegressor} also supports multi-output regression, in which a sample can have more than one target.

%%%% ROM Model - ARMA  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ARMA}
\label{subsubsec:arma}
The ARMA sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on an autoregressive moving average time series model with
Fourier signal processing, sometimes referred to as a FARMA.
%
ARMA is a type of time dependent model that characterizes the autocorrelation between time series data. The mathematic description of ARMA is given as
\begin{equation*}
x_t = \sum_{i=1}^p\phi_ix_{t-i}+\alpha_t+\sum_{j=1}^q\theta_j\alpha_{t-j},
\end{equation*}
where $x$ is a vector of dimension $n$, and $\phi_i$ and $\theta_j$ are both $n$ by $n$ matrices. When $q=0$, the above is
autoregressive (AR); when $p=0$, the above is moving average (MA).
While plans for optimizing $p$ and $q$ are under consideration, currently setting $Pmin$ and $Pmax$ to the
same value is required, and similarly for $Qmin$ and $Qmax$.
%The user is allowed to provide upper and lower limits for $p$
%and $q$ (see below), and the training process will choose the optimal $p$ and $q$ that fall into the user-specified range.
When
training an ARMA, the input needs to be a synchronized HistorySet. For unsynchronized data, use PostProcessor methods to
synchronize the data before training an ARMA.

The ARMA model implemented allows an option to use Fourier series to detrend the time series before fitting to ARMA model to
train. The Fourier trend will be stored in the trained ARMA model for data generation. The following equation
describes the detrending
process.
\begin{equation*}
x_t = y_t - \sum_m\left\{\sum_{k=1}^{K_m}a_k\sin(2\pi kf_mt)+\sum_{k=1}^{K_m}b_k\cos(2\pi kf_mt)\right\},
\end{equation*}
where $K_m$ and $f_m$ are user-defined parameters.

By default, each target in the training will be considered independent and have an unique ARMA for each
target.  Correlated targets can be specified through the \xmlNode{correlate} node, at which point
the correlated targets will be trained together using a vector ARMA (or VARMA). Due to limitations in
the VARMA, in order to seed samples the VARMA must be trained with the node \xmlNode{seed}, which acts
independently from the global random seed used by other RAVEN entities.

Both the ARMA and VARMA make use of the \texttt{statsmodels} python package.

%
In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be \xmlString{ARMA} (see the example
below).
%
\subnodeIntro

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, defines the pivot variable (e.g., time) that is non-decreasing in
  the input HistorySet.
  \item \xmlNode{Features}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines the features (e.g., scaling). Note that only
  one feature is allowed for \xmlString{ARMA} and in current implementation this is used for evaluation only.
  \item \xmlNode{Target}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field}, defines the variable(s) of the
    time series.  Should include the pivot parameter (or Index).
  \item \xmlNode{correlate}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, optional field}, indicates the listed variables
    should be considered as influencing each other, and trained together instead of independently.  This node
    can only be listed once, so all variables that are desired for correlation should be included.  \nb The
    correlated VARMA takes notably longer to train than the independent ARMAs for the same number of targets.
  \item \xmlNode{seed}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, provides seed for ONLY the VARMA sampling.  Has no
    effect on ARMA single-target sampling or other RAVEN entities.  Must be provided before training; it cannot
    be changed once trained.
  \default{True}
  \item \xmlNode{reseedCopies}, \xmlDesc{boolean, optional field}, if True then whenever the ARMA is copied, a
    random reseeding will be performed to ensure different histories.
  \default{True}
  \item \xmlNode{Pmax}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the maximum value of $p$.
  \default{3}
  \item \xmlNode{Pmin}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the minimum value of $p$.
  \default{0}
  \item \xmlNode{Qmax}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the maximum value of $q$.
  \default{3}
  \item \xmlNode{Qmin}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, defines the minimum value of $q$.
  \default{0}
  \item \xmlNode{outTruncation}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated string, optional}, defines whether and how output
    time series are limited in domain. This node has one attribute, \xmlAttr{domain}, whose value can be
    \xmlString{positive} or \xmlString{negative}. The value of this node contains the list of targets to whom
    this domain limitation should be applied. In the event a negative value is discovered in a target whose
    domain is strictly positive, the absolute value of the original negative value will be used instead, and
    similarly for the negative domain.
  \default{None}
  \item \xmlNode{ZeroFilter}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated string, optional field}, turns on \emph{zero filtering}
    for the listed targets. Zero filtering is a very specific algorithm, and should not be used without
    understanding its application.  When zero filtering is enabled, the ARMA will remove all the values from
    the training data equal to zero for the target, then train on the remaining data (including Fourier detrending
    if applicable). If the target is set as correlated to another target, the second target will be treated as
    two distinct series: one containing times in which the original target is zero, and one in the remaining
    times. The results from separated ARMAs are recombined after sampling. This can be a methodology for
    treating histories with long zero-value segments punctuated periodically by peaks.
  \item \xmlNode{Fourier}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated integers, optional field}, must be positive integers. This defines the
    based period that will be used for Fourier detrending, i.e., this field defines $1/f_m$ in the above equation.
    When this filed is not specified, the ARMA considers no Fourier detrend.
  \item \xmlNode{FourierOrder}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated integers, optional field}, must be positive integers. The number of integers specified
    in this field should be exactly same as the number of base periods specified in the node \xmlNode{Fourier}.
    This field defines $K_m$ in the above equation.
  \item \xmlNode{SpecificFourier}, \xmlDesc{node, optional}, provides a means to specify different Fourier
    decomposition for different target variables.  Values given in the subnodes of this node will supercede
    the defaults set by the  \xmlNode{Fourier} and \xmlNode{FourierOrder} nodes.  This node accepts the
    requires the following attribute:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlAttr{variables}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated list, required field}, lists the variables to whom
        the \xmlNode{SpecificFourier} parameters will apply.
    \end{itemize}
    Additionally, the \xmlNode{SpecificFourier} node takes the following subnodes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xmlNode{periods}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated integers, required field}, lists the (fundamental)
        periodic wavelength of the Fourier decomposition for these variables, as in the \xmlNode{Fourier} general node.
      \item \xmlNode{orders}, \xmlDesc{comma-separated integers, required field}, lists the highest integer
        subdivision desired for each period requested in \xmlNode{periods}, as \xmlNode{FourierOrder} above.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%% ROM Model - PolyExponential  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{PolyExponential}
\label{subsubsec:polyexponential}
The PolyExponential sub-type contains a single ROM type, aimed to construct a time-dependent (or any other monotonic
variable) surrogate model based on polynomial sum of exponential term. This surrogate have the form:
%
\begin{equation}
  SM(X,z) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} P_{i}(X) \times \exp ( - Q_{i}(X) \times z )
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbf{z}$ is the independent  monotonic variable (e.g. time)
  \item $\mathbf{X}$  is the vector of the other independent (parametric) variables  (Features)
  \item $\mathbf{P_{i}}(X)$ is a polynomial of rank M function of the parametric space X
  \item  $\mathbf{Q_{i}}(X)$ is a polynomial of rank M function of the parametric space X
  \item  $\mathbf{N}$ is the number of requested exponential terms.
\end{itemize}
It is crucial to notice that this model is quite suitable for FOMs whose drivers are characterized by an exponential-like behavior.
In addition, it is important to notice that the exponential terms' coefficients are computed running a genetic-algorithm optimization
problem, which is quite slow in case of increasing number of ``numberExpTerms''.
%
In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be set equal to \xmlString{PolyExponential} (see the example
below).

  \item \xmlNode{numberExpTerms}, \xmlDesc{integer, optional field}, the number of exponential terms to be used ($N$ above)
   \default{3}

Once the ROM is trained (\textbf{Step} \xmlNode{RomTrainer}), its coefficients can be exported into an XML file

%%%% ROM Model - DMD  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{DMD}
\label{subsubsec:polyexponential}
The DMD sub-type contains a single ROM type, aimed to construct a time-dependent (or any other monotonic
variable) surrogate model based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ref. \cite{Schmid2010DMD} and \cite{Vega2017HODMD}).
This surrogate is aimed to perform a ``dimensionality reduction regression'', where, given time series (or any monotonic-dependent
variable) of data, a set of modes each of which is associated with a fixed oscillation frequency and decay/growth rate is computed
in order to represent the data-set.
%

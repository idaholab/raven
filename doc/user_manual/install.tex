\section{Installation Overview}

The installation of the RAVEN code is a straightforward procedure;
depending on the usage purpose and machine architecture, the
installation process slightly differs.

In the following sections, all the different installation procedures
are reported.

There are two main requirements to installing RAVEN, installing the
RAVEN dependencies and installing RAVEN itself.  For some versions of
OSX, there is a RAVEN complete package that combines theses steps.

For OSX it is recommended that the dependencies be installed with
MiniConda.  For Linux, it is recommended that the distribution package
manager be used if possible.

There are several different ways of getting RAVEN.  They vary
depending on how easy they are to use and how easy they are to develop
with (these tend to be inversely correlated).

\section{RAVEN Dependencies Installation}

There are several different ways to install the dependencies that
RAVEN needs.  For OSX, Miniconda is recommended.  For Linux, the
distribution's package manager is recommended.

\subsection{Linux Package Manager}

If RAVEN is being installed on Linux, it is recommended that the
distribution's package manager be used to install the dependencies.
Below are instructions for doing so in Ubuntu and Fedora.

\subsubsection{Ubuntu}

Install the dependencies using the command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo apt-get install libtool git python-dev swig g++ python3-dev \
 python-numpy python-sklearn python-h5py
\end{lstlisting}

%\maljdan{Somebody verify what \TeX packages are needed under Ubuntu
%(These are what I manually installed according to my
%\texttt{/var/lib/apt/extended\_states} file and things work fine).}
% I verified it.  Josh

Optionally, if you want to be able to edit and rebuild the manual, you can
install \TeX~Live and its related packages:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-extra-utils \
  texlive-latex-extra texlive-math-extra
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Fedora}

Install the dependencies:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
dnf install swig libtool gcc-c++ python-devel python3-devel \
 numpy h5py scipy python-scikit-learn python-matplotlib-qt4
\end{lstlisting}

Optionally, if you want to be able to edit and rebuild the manual, you can
install \TeX~Live and its related packages:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
dnf install texlive texlive-subfigure texlive-stmaryrd \
  texlive-titlesec texlive-preprint
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{OSX Dependencies}

For running OSX, there are two additional dependencies that need to be
installed.  The first in the Xcode command line tools.  The second is
XQuartz.  How to install these is explained at
\url{http://mooseframework.org/getting-started/osx/}

%x quartz

\subsection{Miniconda}

For OSX, the simplest and most robust way to install the RAVEN dependencies
is with Miniconda.  The details of this vary depending what else is
installed.

\subsubsection{With MOOSE}

If running other MOOSE packages is needed, then MOOSE's MOOSE
Environment package comes with miniconda and that should be used to
install the RAVEN dependencies.

Then:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  sudo bash
  #Set up http_proxy and https_proxy variables if needed
  conda install numpy hdf5 h5py scipy scikit-learn matplotlib swig
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Direct Miniconda}

Miniconda can be directly installed using the instructions at: \url{http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html}

Then the packages RAVEN needs can be installed:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  conda install numpy hdf5 h5py scipy scikit-learn matplotlib swig
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{With Miniconda package}

For OSX Yosemite and OSX Mavericks there is a package available called
raven\_miniconda.dmg The package includes both miniconda and the
dependencies RAVEN needs.

\subsection{Manual Dependency Install}

If other options don't work, the dependencies can be installed
manually.  RAVEN uses the following packages (newer versions usually
work):

\begin{enumerate}
\item numpy-1.7.0
\item hdf5-1.8.12
\item Cython-0.18
\item h5py-2.2.1
\item scipy-0.12.0
\item scikit-learn-0.14.1
\item matplotlib-1.4.0
\end{enumerate}

You may install these dependencies yourself, or by running the
\texttt{raven\_libs\_script.sh} script provided within the RAVEN distribution:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
#Only use raven_libs_script.sh if other methods don't work
cd full_path_to_raven_distribution/raven/
./raven_libs_script.sh
cd ..
\end{lstlisting}

\section{RAVEN Installation}

Once the RAVEN dependencies have been installed, the rest of RAVEN can
be installed.

\subsection{Parallel Directory Git}

This install method uses git to obtain the software, and the raven,
crow, and moose directories are installed at the same level.  This is
used to allow other MOOSE applications to share the same MOOSE and
libmesh.

First follow the MOOSE getting started instructions:  \url{http://mooseframework.org/getting-started/}

This is generally:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/idaholab/moose.git
cd  moose/scripts
./update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh
cd ../../
\end{lstlisting}

Next Crow and RAVEN need to be cloned:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:idaholab/crow.git
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:idaholab/raven.git
\end{lstlisting}

Next the RAVEN modules should be compiled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd raven
make framework_modules
\end{lstlisting}

Then the testing should be done:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  ./run_framework_tests
\end{lstlisting}

The output should describe why any tests failed.

At the end, there should be a line that looks similar to the output below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
8 passed, 19 skipped, 0 pending, 0 failed
\end{lstlisting}

Normally there are skipped tests because either some of the codes are
not available, or some of the test are not currently working.  The
output will explain why each is skipped.

To update the software, the git pull command can be used:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  cd moose
  git pull
  #Possibly libmesh needs to be rebuilt at this point.
  cd ../crow
  git pull
  cd ../raven
  git pull
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Submodule Git}

This install method uses git to obtain the software and uses
submodules to get Crow and MOOSE.  This can be used for RAVEN and Crow
development.

First RAVEN needs to be cloned, and then the submodules initialized.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:idaholab/raven.git
  cd raven
  git submodule update --init crow moose
\end{lstlisting}

Next the RAVEN modules should be compiled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
#make sure you are in the raven directory
make framework_modules
\end{lstlisting}

Then the testing should be done:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  ./run_framework_tests
\end{lstlisting}

The output should describe why any tests failed.

At the end, there should be a line that looks similar to the output below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
8 passed, 19 skipped, 0 pending, 0 failed
\end{lstlisting}

Normally there are skipped tests because either some of the codes are
not available, or some of the test are not currently working.  The
output will explain why each is skipped.


To update the software, the git pull and submodule update commands can
be used:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  git pull
  git submodule update
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{RAVEN Whole Devel Branch}

This install method uses git to get a custom repository that includes
only the parts of Crow and MOOSE that are needed by RAVEN.

First clone the RAVEN whole repository:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:cogljj/raven.git
  cd raven
\end{lstlisting}

Next the RAVEN modules should be compiled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make framework_modules
\end{lstlisting}

Then the testing should be done:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  ./run_framework_tests
\end{lstlisting}

The output should describe why any tests failed.

At the end, there should be a line that looks similar to the output below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
8 passed, 19 skipped, 0 pending, 0 failed
\end{lstlisting}

Normally there are skipped tests because either some of the codes are
not available, or some of the test are not currently working.  The
output will explain why each is skipped.


To update the software, the git pull command can be used:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  git pull
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{RAVEN Whole Stable Branch}

This is the same as in the previous section, but after the clone
command a stable branch is checked out:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:cogljj/raven.git
  cd raven
  git checkout stable/2015_july
\end{lstlisting}

The rest is the same as the RAVEN Whole devel branch.  The stable
branches are update less frequently, and input changes that would
invalidate existing files are not allowed.

\subsection{RAVEN Source Code Package}

Untar the source install (if there is more than one version of the
source tarball, the full filename will need to be used instead of *):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
tar -xvzf raven_framework_*_source.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

Next the RAVEN modules should be compiled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  cd raven
  make framework_modules
\end{lstlisting}

Then the testing should be done:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  ./run_framework_tests
\end{lstlisting}

The output should describe why any tests failed.

At the end, there should be a line that looks similar to the output below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
8 passed, 19 skipped, 0 pending, 0 failed
\end{lstlisting}

Normally there are skipped tests because either some of the codes are
not available, or some of the test are not currently working.  The
output will explain why each is skipped.

\subsection{RAVEN Complete}

Open up the file \texttt{raven\_framework\_complete\_version.dmg}.
%
Next, Open up the \texttt{raven\_libs.pkg} inside, and install it.  If
you get an error that the package is not signed, then Control click
the package, and choose ``Open With'' and then Installer.
%
The files will be installed into \texttt{/opt/raven\_libs}.
%
Your \texttt{.bash\_profile} will be modified to source the
\texttt{/opt/raven\_libs/environments/raven\_libs\_profile} file.
%
This file sets up the environment variables \texttt{PYTHONPATH} and
\texttt{PATH} so that the \texttt{raven\_framework} command can be used.

\subsection{Troubleshooting the Installation}

Often the problems result from one or more of the libraries being
incorrect or missing.  In the raven directory, the command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./run_tests --library_report
\end{lstlisting}
can be used to check if all the libraries are available, and which
ones are being used.  If amsc, distribution1D or interpolationND are
missing, then the RAVEN modules need to be compiled or recompiled.
Otherwise, the RAVEN dependencies need to be fixed.

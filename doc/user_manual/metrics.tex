\newcommand{\metrictypeI}[3]
{
  This metric interface directly with the metric available within \textit{#1}.
  The specifications of this metric must be defined within the XML block \xmlNode{#2}.
  This XML node needs to contain the following subnode:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlNode{metricType}\texttt{#3}\xmlNode{/metricType}, \xmlDesc{vertical bar (\texttt{|}) separated
      string, required field}.
  \end{itemize}

}
\newcommand{\metrictypeII}[3]
{
  \metrictypeI{#1}{#2}{#3}

  In addition to this XML subnode, the users can also specify the weights for given metric:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlNode{w}, \xmlDesc{comma separated floats, optional parameter}, the weights for each value in \textit{u}
      and \textit{v}. Default is None, which gives each value a weight of 1.0.
  \end{itemize}
}

\newcommand{\metrictypeIII}[3]
{
  \metrictypeI{#1}{#2}{#3}

  In addition to this XML subnode, the users can also specify the weights for given metric:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlNode{sample\_weight}, \xmlDesc{comma separated floats, optional parameter}, the weights for each value in \textit{u}
      and \textit{v}. Default is None, which gives each value a weight of 1.0.
  \end{itemize}
}

The Metrics block allows the user to specify the similarity/dissimilarity metrics to be used for other
RAVEN entities, such as \textbf{PostProcessors}, and \textbf{HybridModel}.

In the RAVEN input file these metrics are defined as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Simulation>
  ...
  <Metrics>
    ...
    <MetricID name='metricName'>
      ...
     <param1>value</param1>
      ...
    </MetricID>
    ...
  </Metrics>
  ...
</Simulation>
\end{lstlisting}

The metrics, that are available in RAVEN, can be categorized into several main classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Paired Distance Metric}, distance metrics between two variables $u$ and $v$, such as \xmlString{euclidean},
    \xmlString{manhattan}, \xmlString{minkowski} and so on.
  \item \textbf{Regression Metric}, measure the regression performance, such as \xmlString{mean\_squared\_error},
    \xmlString{r2\_score}, \xmlString{explained\_variance\_score} and \xmlString{mean\_absolute\_error}.
  \item \textbf{Boolean Metric}, distance metrics between two boolean variables $u$ and $v$, such as
    \xmlString{dice}, \xmlString{hamming}, \xmlString{yule} and so on.
  \item \textbf{Pairwise Metric}, compute the distance or kernel between each pair of the two collections of input
    or observations in n-dimensional space.
    \nb These metrics can be only used in the clustering post-processor of data mining. 
  \item \textbf{Other metric}, such as \xmlString{DTW}.
\end{itemize}

The valid \textbf{MetricID}s are: \xmlNode{SKL}, \xmlNode{ScipyMetric}, \xmlNode{DTW}, \xmlNode{CDFAreaDifference},
and \xmlNode{PDFCommonArea}. This XML node requires the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlAttr{name}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, user-defined name of this metric. \nb As with other
    objects, this name can be used to refer to this specific entity from other input blocks in the XML.
\end{itemize}

\nb If you are using \xmlNode{ScipyMetric}, please pay more attention on the weight associated with the metric
calculations. Scipy does not normalize the weight during the calculation, and the results can be significant difference
from the normalized weight.

In RAVEN, lots of metrics are just interfaces directly with metrics available within \textbf{Scipy} and
\textbf{SciKit-Learn}. In this case, the algorithm for the metrics is choosen by the subnode \xmlNode{metricType}
under the parent node \xmlNode{SKL} (metric from SciKit-Learn) or \xmlNode{ScipyMetric} (metric from Scipy). For
example, \xmlNode{metricType}\xmlString{paired\_distance|euclidean}\xmlNode{/metricType}.

In the following sub-sections, the input requirements for all of the metrics are presented in the following sections.

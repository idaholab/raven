\subsection{Conda: Python Dependencies}
\label{sec:install conda}

The standard installation procedure for RAVEN includes using Miniconda (often simply referred to as
\emph{conda}) to install the Python libraries required to run RAVEN.  If conda cannot be made available on an
operating system, refer to the wiki (listed above) for alternatives.  To install miniconda, follow the
instructions for your operating system at \url{https://conda.io/miniconda.html}.

\nb Since RAVEN currently relies
on some Python 2.7-only libraries, make sure to install the 2.7 64-bit version of miniconda.

Once conda is installed, proceed to installing RAVEN itself (section \ref{sec:clone raven}).

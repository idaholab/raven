\subsection{Mac OSX Installation}
\label{sec:install mac}

When using an Apple Macintosh computer, software dependencies are met
by following steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Install the XCode command line tools from Apple,
  \item Install the XQuartz  X-Window system server,
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Installing XCode Command Line Tools}

The XCode command line tools package from Apple Computer provides the C++
compilers and git source code control tools needed to obtain and build RAVEN.
It is freely available from the Apple store. In order to obtain it the following command should be launched in an open terminal:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 xcode-select --install
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Installing XQuartz}
XQuartz is an implementation of the X Server for the Mac OSX operating system.
XQuartz is freely available on the web and can be downloaded from the link
 \url{https://dl.bintray.com/xquartz/downloads/XQuartz-2.7.9.dmg}.
\\After downloaded, install the package.

With XCode and XQuartz installed, continue on to install conda (see section \ref{sec:install conda}).

\nb While \texttt{gcc} and
\texttt{git} are also required, they are installed by default in the OSX system.

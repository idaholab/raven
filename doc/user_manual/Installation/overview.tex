\section{Installation Overview}
\label{sec:install overview}

The installation of the RAVEN code is a straightforward procedure;
depending on the usage purpose and machine architecture, the
installation process slightly differs.

In the following sections, the recommended installation procedure is outlined.  For alternatives, we encourage
checking the \wiki.  The machines on which
RAVEN is tested and developed, however, use the standard installation procedures outlined below.

The installation process will involve three steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Installing prerequisites, which depends on your operating system;
  \item Installing conda;
  \item Installing RAVEN.
\end{itemize}

Depending on your operating system (Windows in section \ref{sec:install windows}, MacOSX in section
\ref{sec:install mac}, Ubuntu Linux in section \ref{sec:install ubunutu}), follow the instructions for installing prerequisites, then continue with
installing conda (section \ref{sec:install conda}), and then installing RAVEN (section \ref{sec:clone raven}).

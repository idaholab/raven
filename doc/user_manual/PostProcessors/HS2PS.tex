\subsubsection{HS2PS}
\label{HS2PS}

This PostProcessor performs a conversion from HistorySet to PointSet.
The conversion is made so that each history $H$ is converted to a single point $P$.
Assume that each history $H$ is a dictionary (mapping) of $n$ output variables $x_1=[...],x_n=[...]$, then the resulting point $P$ is $P=concat(x_1,...,x_n)$.
Note: it is here assumed that all histories have been synced so that they have the same length, start point and end point. 
If you are not sure, do a pre-processing the the original history set.

\ppType{HS2PS}{HS2PS}

In the \xmlNode{PostProcessor} input block, the following XML sub-nodes are required,
independent of the \xmlAttr{subType} specified (min, max, avg and value case):

\begin{itemize}
   \item \xmlNode{pivotParameter}, \xmlDesc{string, optional field}, ID of the temporal variable (only for avg)
\end{itemize}

\newcommand{\xmlExample}[3][0]{

%  NOTES for using this command:
%  Requires the writeTex.py module to work.
%  The highlighted additional keywords need to be a comma-separated list with NO spaces between entries.
%  The node path should start AFTER <root> and use periods to separate the path, with NO spaces between them
%    -> It is also possible to request the root alone, as in {Simulation}
%  Example usage: \xmlExample[features,targets]{myFile.xml}{Models.ROM}

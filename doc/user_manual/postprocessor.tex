\subsection{PostProcessor}
\label{sec:models_postProcessor}
A Post-Processor (PP) can be considered as an action performed on a set of data
or other type of objects.
%
Most of the post-processors contained in RAVEN, employ a mathematical operation
on the data given as ``input''.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of PPs.

Currently, the following types are available in RAVEN:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \textbf{BasicStatistics}
  \item \textbf{ComparisonStatistics}
  \item \textbf{ImportanceRank}
  \item \textbf{SafestPoint}
  \item \textbf{LimitSurface}
  \item \textbf{LimitSurfaceIntegral}
  \item \textbf{External}
  \item \textbf{TopologicalDecomposition}
  \item \textbf{DataMining}
  \item \textbf{ParetoFrontier}
  \item \textbf{Metric}
  \item \textbf{CrossValidation}
  \item \textbf{ValueDuration}
  \item \textbf{FastFourierTransform}
  \item \textbf{SampleSelector}
  \item \textbf{Validation}
  \item \textbf{EconomicRatio}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetDelay}
  \item \textbf{HStoPSOperator}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetSampling}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetSync}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetSnapShot}
  \item \textbf{HS2PS}
  \item \textbf{TypicalHistoryFromHistorySet}
  \item \textbf{dataObjectLabelFilter}
  \item \textbf{TSACharacterizer}
  \item \textbf{SparseSensing}
\end{itemize}

The specifications of these types must be defined within the XML block
\xmlNode{PostProcessor}.
%
This XML node needs to contain the attributes:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \xmlAttr{name}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, user-defined
  identifier of this post-processor.
  %
  \nb As with other objects, this is the name that can be used to refer to this
  specific entity from other input XML blocks.
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines which of
  the post-processors needs to be used, choosing among the previously reported
  types.
  %
  This choice conditions the subsequent required and/or optional
  \xmlNode{PostProcessor} sub nodes.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

As already mentioned, all the types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes
depend on the post-processor type specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.

Based on the \xmlAttr{construction} type, the content of the \xmlNode{grid}
XML node and the requirements for other attributes change:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlAttr{construction}\textbf{\texttt{=}}\xmlString{equal}.
    The grid is going to be constructed equally-spaced
    (\xmlAttr{type}\textbf{\texttt{=}}\xmlString{value}).
    This construction type requires the definition of additional attributes:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \xmlAttr{steps}, \xmlDesc{required integer attribute}, number
           of equally spaced/probable discretization steps.
      \end{itemize}
      This construction type requires that the content of the \xmlNode{grid}
      node represents the lower and upper bounds (either
      in probability or value). Two values need to be specified; the lowest one
     will be considered as the $lowerBound$, the largest, the $upperBound$.
      The $stepSize$ is determined as follows:
      \\ $stepSize=(upperBound - lowerBound)/steps$
  \item \xmlAttr{construction}\textbf{\texttt{=}}\xmlString{custom}.
    The grid will be directly specified by the user.
    No additional attributes are needed.
    This construction type requires that the \xmlNode{grid} node contains
    the actual mesh bins.
    For example, if the grid \xmlAttr{type} is \xmlString{value}, in the body
    of \xmlNode{grid}, the user will specify the values representing the nodes of the grid.
\end{itemize}
}

\newcommand{\gridDescriptionNoCDF}
{
  \xmlNode{grid}, \xmlDesc{space separated floats, required
  field}, the content of this XML node allows for a type of the grid only:
  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
    \item \xmlAttr{type}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, user-defined
      discretization metric type: 1) \xmlString{value}, the grid will be provided
      using variable values.
    \item \xmlAttr{construction}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, how
      the grid needs to be constructed, independent of its type.
  \end{itemize}

A Post-Processor (PP) can be considered as an action performed on a set of data
or other type of objects.
%
Most of the post-processors contained in RAVEN, employ a mathematical operation
on the data given as ``input''.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of PPs.

Currently, the following types are available in RAVEN:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \textbf{BasicStatistics}
  \item \textbf{SubdomainBasicStatistics}
  \item \textbf{ComparisonStatistics}
  \item \textbf{ImportanceRank}
  \item \textbf{SafestPoint}
  \item \textbf{LimitSurface}
  \item \textbf{LimitSurfaceIntegral}
  \item \textbf{External}
  \item \textbf{TopologicalDecomposition}
  \item \textbf{DataMining}
  \item \textbf{ParetoFrontier}
  \item \textbf{Metric}
  \item \textbf{CrossValidation}
  \item \textbf{ValueDuration}
  \item \textbf{FastFourierTransform}
  \item \textbf{SampleSelector}
  \item \textbf{Validation}
  \item \textbf{EconomicRatio}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetDelay}
  \item \textbf{HStoPSOperator}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetSampling}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetSync}
  \item \textbf{HistorySetSnapShot}
  \item \textbf{HS2PS}
  \item \textbf{TypicalHistoryFromHistorySet}
  \item \textbf{dataObjectLabelFilter}
  \item \textbf{TSACharacterizer}
  \item \textbf{SparseSensing}
\end{itemize}

The specifications of these types must be defined within the XML block
\xmlNode{PostProcessor}.
%
This XML node needs to contain the attributes:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \xmlAttr{name}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, user-defined
  identifier of this post-processor.
  %
  \nb As with other objects, this is the name that can be used to refer to this
  specific entity from other input XML blocks.
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines which of
  the post-processors needs to be used, choosing among the previously reported
  types.
  %
  This choice conditions the subsequent required and/or optional
  \xmlNode{PostProcessor} sub nodes.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

As already mentioned, all the types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes
depend on the post-processor type specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MooseBasedApp Interface}
\subsubsection{Files}
In the \xmlNode{Files} section, as specified before, all of the files needed for
the code to run should be specified.
%
In the case of any MooseBasedApp, the files typically needed are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MooseBasedApp GetPot input file
  \item Restart Files (if the calculation is instantiated from a restart point)
  \item Mesh Files (in case the mesh is externally specified)
  \item Any other generic input file (CSVs with Power histories, boundary conditions files, etc.)
\end{itemize}
Example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Files>
  <Input name='mooseBasedApp.i' type=''>mooseBasedApp.i</Input>
  <Input name='0020_mesh.cpr' type=''>0020_mesh.cpr</Input>
  <Input name='0020.xdr.0000' type="">0020.xdr.0000</Input>
  <Input name='0020.rd-0' type="">0020.rd-0</Input>
  <Input name='exodus_mesh.e' type="">exodus_mesh.e</Input>
  <Input name='a_generic_additional_input_file.csv' type="Generic">a_generic_additional_input_file.csv</Input>
</Files>
\end{lstlisting}
If any file is tagged with the type \texttt{Generic}, it will be perturbed with the approach (wildcards)
 explained in the generic code interface (see  \ref{subsec:genericInterface}).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Models}
In the \xmlNode{Models} block particular MooseBasedApp executable needs to be specified.
%
Here is a standard example of what can be used to use with a typical MooseBasedApp (Bison) as the model:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Models>
    <Code name='MyMooseBasedApp' subType='MooseBasedApp'>
      <executable>~path/to/Bison-opt</executable>
    </Code>
</Models>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Distributions}
The \xmlNode{Distributions} block defines the distributions that are going
to be used for the sampling of the variables defined in the \xmlNode{Samplers}
block.
%
For all the possible distributions and all their possible inputs please see the
chapter about Distributions (see~\ref{sec:distributions}).
%
Here we give a general example of three different distributions:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,debug}]
<Distributions>
    <Normal name='ThermalConductivity1'>
        <mean>1</mean>
        <sigma>0.001</sigma>
        <lowerBound>0.5</lowerBound>
        <upperBound>1.5</upperBound>
    </Normal>
    <Normal name='SpecificHeat'>
        <mean>1</mean>
        <sigma>0.4</sigma>
        <lowerBound>0.5</lowerBound>
        <upperBound>1.5</upperBound>
    </Normal>
    <Triangular name='ThermalConductivity2'>
        <apex>1</apex>
        <min>0.1</min>
        <max>4</max>
    </Triangular>
</Distributions>
\end{lstlisting}

It is good practice to name the distribution something similar to what kind of
variable is going to be sampled, since there might be many variables with the
same kind of distributions but different input parameters.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Samplers}
In the \xmlNode{Samplers} block we want to define the variables that are going
to be sampled.
%
\textbf{Example}:
We want to do the sampling of 3 variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Thermal Conductivity of the Fuel;
  \item Specific Heat Transfer Ratio of the Cladding;
  \item Thermal Conductivity of the Cladding.
\end{itemize}

We are going to sample these 3 variables using two different sampling methods:
Grid and Monte-Carlo.

In order to perturb any MooseBasedApp, the user needs to specify the variables to be
sampled indicating the path to the value separated with the symbol ``$|$''. For example,
if the variable that we want to perturb is specified in the input as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
[Materials]
  ...
  [./heatStructure]
     ...
     thermal_conductivity = 1.0
     ...
  [../]
  ...
[]
\end{lstlisting}
the variable name in the Sampler input block needs to be named as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
...
<Samplers>
  <aSampler name='aUserDefinedName' >
    <variable name='Materials|heatStructure|thermal_conductivity'>
      ...
    </variable>
  </aSampler>
</Samplers>
...
\end{lstlisting}

%
In case the variables have multiple entries, for example, variable `w' as shown in the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
[Functions]
  ...
  [./the_linear_combo]
    type = LinearCombinationFunction
    functions = 'xtimes twoxplus1 xsquared tover2'
    w = '3 -1.2 0.4 3'
  [../]
  ...
[]
\end{lstlisting}
The users can append `:' to the end of the variable, and use an integer number to indicate which
entry value to be perturbed by RAVEN.
For example, if the user wants to perturb the first
and third values of `w' in the aboved example, the RAVEN Sampler will be updated as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
...
<Samplers>
  <aSampler name='aUserDefinedName' >
    <variable name='Functions|the_linear_combo|w:1'>
      ...
    </variable>
    <variable name='Functions|the_linear_combo|w:3'>
      ...
    </variable>
  </aSampler>
</Samplers>
...
\end{lstlisting}

%
In case some variables in external (\texttt{Generic} input files) need to be perturbed,
the wildcard approach can be used (for those variables):
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
...
<Samplers>
  <aSampler name='aUserDefinedName' >
    <variable name='aWildCard1'>
      ...
    </variable>
        <variable name='aWildCard2'>
      ...
    </variable>
    <variable name='Materials|heatStructure|thermal_conductivity'>
      ...
    </variable>
  </aSampler>
</Samplers>
...
\end{lstlisting}
In this case the tagged file (\texttt{Generic}) will be parsed to find the variables
\texttt{\$RAVEN-aWildCard1\$} and \texttt{\$RAVEN-aWildCard1\$} and to replace their values
with the corresponding sampled variables (for more details, see  \ref{subsec:genericInterface})

In this example, we proceed to do so for both the Grid sampling and the Monte-Carlo sampling.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,type,construction,lowerBound,steps,limit,initialSeed}]
<Samplers verbosity='debug'>
    <Grid name='myGrid'>
      <variable name='Materials|heatStructure1|thermal_conductivity' >
        <distribution>ThermalConductivity1</distribution>
        <grid         type='value' construction='custom' >0.6 0.7 0.8</grid>
      </variable>
      <variable name='Materials|heatStructure1|specific_heat' >
        <distribution >SpecificHeat</distribution>
        <grid         type='CDF'    construction='custom'>0.5 1.0 0.0</grid>
      </variable>
      <variable name='Materials|heatStructure2|thermal_conductivity'>
        <distribution  >ThermalConductivity2</distribution>
        <grid type='value' upperBound='4' construction='equal' steps='1'>0.5</grid>
      </variable>
      <variable name='aWildCard1'>
        <distribution  >ThermalConductivity2</distribution>
        <grid type='value' upperBound='4' construction='equal' steps='1'>0.5</grid>
      </variable>
    </Grid>
  <MonteCarlo name='MC_Sampler' limit='1000'>
      <variable name='Materials|heatStructure1|thermal_conductivity' >
        <distribution>ThermalConductivity1</distribution>
      </variable>
      <variable name='Materials|heatStructure1|specific_heat' >
        <distribution >SpecificHeat</distribution>
      </variable>
      <variable name='Materials|heatStructure2|thermal_conductivity'>
        <distribution  >ThermalConductivity2</distribution>
      </variable>
      <variable name='aWildCard1'>
        <distribution  >ThermalConductivity2</distribution>
      </variable>
  </MonteCarlo>
</Samplers>
\end{lstlisting}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Steps}
For a MooseBasedApp, the \xmlNode{MultiRun} step type will most likely be
used, as first step.
%
First, the step needs to be named: this name will be one of the names used in
the \xmlNode{Sequence} block.
%
In our example, \texttt{Grid\_Sampler} and \texttt{MC\_Sampler}.
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,debug,re-seeding}]
     <MultiRun name='Grid_Sampler' >
\end{lstlisting}

With this step, we need to import all the files needed for the simulation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MooseBasedApp YAML input file;
  \item eventual restart files (optional);
  \item other auxiliary files (e.g., powerHistory tables, etc.).
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,class,type}]
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>mooseBasedApp.i</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>0020_mesh.cpr</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>0020.xdr.0000</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>0020.rd-0</Input>
\end{lstlisting}
We then need to define which model will be used:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
    <Model  class='Models' type='Code'>MyMooseBasedApp</Model>
\end{lstlisting}
We then need to specify which Sampler is used, and this can be done as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
    <Sampler class='Samplers' type='Grid'>Grid_Sampler</Sampler>
\end{lstlisting}
And lastly, we need to specify what kind of output the user wants.
%
For example the user might want to make a database (in RAVEN the database
created is an HDF5 file) and a DataObject of type PointSet, to use in sub-sequential
post-processing.
%
Here is a classical example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={class,type}]
    <Output  class='Databases' type='HDF5'>MC_out</Output>
    <Output  class='DataObjects' type='PointSet'>MCOutData</Output>
\end{lstlisting}

Following is the example of two MultiRun steps which use different sampling
methods (grid and Monte Carlo), and creating two different databases for each
one:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Steps verbosity='debug'>
  <MultiRun name='Grid_Sampler' verbosity='debug'>
    <Input  class='Files' type=''>mooseBasedApp.i</Input>
    <Input  class='Files' type=''>0020_mesh.cpr</Input>
    <Input  class='Files' type='' >0020.xdr.0000</Input>
    <Input  class='Files' type=''>0020.rd-0</Input>
    <Model  class='Models'    type='Code'>MyMooseBasedApp</Model>
    <Sampler class='Samplers'  type='Grid'>Grid_Sampler</Sampler>
    <Output  class='Databases' type='HDF5'>Grid_out</Output>
    <Output  class='DataObjects' type='PointSet'>gridOutData</Output>
  </MultiRun>
  <MultiRun name='MC_Sampler' verbosity='debug' re-seeding='210491'>
    <Input  class='Files' type=''>mooseBasedApp.i</Input>
    <Input  class='Files' type=''>0020_mesh.cpr</Input>
    <Input  class='Files' type='' >0020.xdr.0000</Input>
    <Input  class='Files' type=''>0020.rd-0</Input>
    <Model  class='Models'    type='Code'>MyMooseBasedApp</Model>
    <Sampler class='Samplers'  type='MonteCarlo' >MC_Sampler</Sampler>
    <Output  class='Databases' type='HDF5' >MC_out</Output>
    <Output  class='DataObjects' type='PointSet'>MCOutData</Output>
  </MultiRun>
</Steps>
\end{lstlisting}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Databases}
As shown in the \xmlNode{Steps} block, the code is creating two database objects
called \texttt{Grid\_out} and \texttt{MC\_out}.
%
So the user needs to input the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Databases>
  <HDF5 name="Grid_out" readMode="overwrite"/>
  <HDF5 name="MC_out" readMode="overwrite"/>
</Databases>
\end{lstlisting}
As listed before, this will create two databases.
%
The files will have names corresponding to their \xmlAttr{name} appended with
the .h5 extension (i.e. \texttt{Grid\_out.h5} and \texttt{MC\_out.h5}).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{DataObjects}
As shown in the \xmlNode{Steps} block, the code is creating two DataObjects of type PointSet
called \texttt{gridOutData} and \texttt{MCOutData}.
%
So the user needs to input the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<DataObjects>
    <PointSet name='gridOutData'>
      <Input>
          Materials|heatStructure2|thermal_conductivity,
          Materials|heatStructure1|specific_heat,
          Materials|heatStructure2|thermal_conductivity
      </Input>
      <Output>aveTempLeft</Output>
    </PointSet>
    <PointSet name='MCOutData'>
      <Input>
          Materials|heatStructure2|thermal_conductivity,
          Materials|heatStructure1|specific_heat,
          Materials|heatStructure2|thermal_conductivity
      </Input>
      <Output>aveTempLeft</Output>
    </PointSet>
</DataObjects>
\end{lstlisting}
As listed before, this will create two DataObjects that can be used in sub-sequential post-processing.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{OutStreams}
As fully explained in section~\ref{sec:outstream}, if the user want to print out or plot the content of a \textbf{DataObjects},
he needs to create an \textbf{OutStream} in the \xmlNode{OutStreams} XML block.
\\As it shown in the example below, for MooseBasedApp (and any other Code interface that might use the symbol $|$
for the Sampler's variable syntax), in the Plot \xmlNode{x} and \xmlNode{y} specification, the user needs to
utilize curly brackets.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<OutStreams>
  <Print name='gridOutDataDumpCSV'>
    <type>csv</type>
    <source>gridOutData</source>
  </Print>
   <Plot verbosity='debug' name='test'   overwrite='False'>
    <plotSettings>
       <plot>
        <type>line</type>
        <x>
          MCOutData|Input|{Materials|heatStructure2|thermal_conductivity}
        </x>
        <y>MCOutData|Output|aveTempLeft</y>
        <kwargs><color>blue</color></kwargs>
      </plot>
    </plotSettings>
    <actions><how>screen,png</how></actions>
  </Plot>
</OutStreams>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%% Moose VectorPostProcessor INTERFACE  %%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MooseVPP Interface}

The Moose Vector Post Processor is used mainly in the solid mechanics analysis.
This interface loads the values of the vector ouput processor to a \xmlNode{DataObjects} object.

To use this interface the [DomainIntegral] needs to be present in the MooseBasedApp's
 input file and the subnode \xmlNode{fileargs} should be defined in the subnode \xmlNode{Code} in
 the \xmlNode{Models} block of the RAVEN input file. The \xmlNode{fileargs} is required to have attributes with
the below specified values:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlAttr{type}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, must be ``MooseVPP''
    \item \xmlAttr{arg}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, the string value attached to the vector post processor action
         while creating the output files.
\end{itemize}

This interface is actually identical to the MooseBasedApp interface, however there is
 few constraints on defining the output values of the post processor.
The definition of these outputs in the \xmlNode{DataObjects} depends on the definition of
 the [DomainIntegral].

The location of the value outputted is defined as \textit{ID\#} and the value is as
\textit{value\#}. The ''\#'' defines
the number of the location. The example below contains 3 locations in the [DomainIntegral]
where the values are outputted.

%
Example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
 ...
  <Models>
    <Code name="MOOSETestApp" subType="MooseBasedApp">
      <executable>%FRAMEWORK_DIR%/../../moose/
        modules/combined/modules-%METHOD%</executable>
      <fileargs type = "MooseVPP" arg = "_J_1_" />
      <alias variable = "poissonsRatio" >
        Materials|stiffStuff|poissons_ratio</alias>
      <alias variable = "youngModulus"  >
        Materials|stiffStuff|youngs_modulus</alias>
    </Code>
  </Models>
 ...
  <DataObjects>
    <PointSet name="collset">
      <Input>youngModulus,poissonsRatio</Input>
      <Output>ID1,ID2,ID3,value1,value2,value3</Output>
    </PointSet>
  </DataObjects>
 ...
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%% MESH GENERATION COUPLED INTERFACES %%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Mesh Generation Coupled Interfaces}
Some software requires a provided mesh that requires a separate code run to generate.
In these cases, we use sampled geometric
variables to generate a new mesh for each perturbation of the original problem, then run the input with
the remainder of the perturbed parameters and the perturbed mesh.  RAVEN currently provides two interfaces for
this type of calculation, listed below.

%%%%%%%%%% CUBIT MOOSE INTERFACE %%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{MooseBasedApp and Cubit Interface}
Many MOOSE-based applications use Cubit (\url{https://cubit.sandia.gov}) to generate Exodus II files as
geometry and meshing for calculations.  To use the developed interface, Cubit's
bin directory must be added to the user's PYTHONPATH.  Input parameters for Cubit can be listed in a journal
(\texttt{.jou}) file.  Parameter values
are typically hardcoded into the Cubit command syntax, but variables may be
predefined in a journal file through Aprepro syntax.  This is an example of a journal
file that generates a rectangle of given height and width, meshes it, defines its
volume and sidesets, lists its element type, and writes it as an Exodus file:

%Cubit (\url{https://cubit.sandia.gov}) is a toolkit developed at Sandia National
%Laboratory used to create two- and three-dimensional finite element meshes with
%various options for defining geometric properties as a part of the grid. It is
%capable of reading and writing a variety of standard mesh file types, including
%Genesis or Exodus II (*.e) files.  As MOOSE applications use Exodus II files for
%meshes and results, Cubit is commonly used to generate meshes for problems of
%interest.  Cubit commands are used to create the geometry, mesh the object, and
%identify volumes, sidesets, and nodesets for a mesh.  These commands may be
%placed in journal files (*.jou) to be used as input to Cubit.  Parameter values
%are typically hardcoded into the Cubit command syntax, but variables may be
%predefined in a journal file through Aprepro syntax.  An example of a journal
%file that generates a rectangle of given height and width, meshes it, defines its
%volume and sidesets, lists its element type, and writes it as an Exodus file is given:

\begin{lstlisting}
#{x = 3}
#{y = 3}
#{out_name = "'out_mesh.e'"}
create surface rectangle width {x} height {y} zplane
mesh surface 1
set duplicate block elements off
block 1 surface 1
Sideset 1 curve 3
Sideset 2 curve 4
Sideset 3 curve 1
Sideset 4 curve 2
Block all element type QUAD4
export genesis {out_name} overwrite
\end{lstlisting}

The first three lines are the Aprepro variable definitions that RAVEN requires to
insert sampled variables.  All variables that RAVEN samples
need to be defined as Aprepro variables in the journal
file.
%These are typically geometric parameters, though almost anything that Cubit
%quantifies in a command may be defined as a variable and sampled through RAVEN
%such as internal mesh refinement values.
One essential caveat to running
this interface is that an Aprepro variable MUST be defined with the name "out\_name".
In order to run this script without RAVEN inserting the correct syntax for the
output file name and properly generate the Exodus file for a mesh, the output file
name is REQUIRED to be in both single and double quotation marks with the file
extension appended to the end of the file base name (e.g. '"output\_file.e"').

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Files}
\xmlNode{Files} works the same as in other interfaces with name and type
attributes for each node entry.  The \xmlAttr{name} attribute is a user-chosen internal
name for the file contained in the node, and \xmlAttr{type} identifies which base-level
interface the file is used within.  \xmlNode{type} should only be specified for inputs
that RAVEN will perturb.  For Moose input files, \xmlNode{type} should be \xmlString{MooseInput} and for
Cubit journal files, the \xmlNode{type} should be \xmlString{CubitInput}.  The node should contain the
path to the file from the working directory.  The following is an example
of a typical \xmlNode{Files} block.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Files>
  <Input name='moose_test' type='MooseInput'>simple_diffusion.i</Input>
  <Input name='mesh_in'    type='CubitInput'>rectangle.jou</Input>
  <Input name='other_file' type=''          >some_file_moose_input_needs.ext</Input>
</Files>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Models}
The user provides paths to executables and aliases for sampled variables within the
\xmlNode{Models} block.  The \xmlNode{Code} block will contain attributes name and
subType.  Name identifies that particular \xmlNode{Code} model within RAVEN, and
subType specifies which code interface the model will use. The \xmlNode{executable}
block should contain the absolute or relative (with respect to the current working
directory) path to the MooseBasedApp that RAVEN will use to run generated input
files.  The absolute or relative path to the Cubit executable is specified within
\xmlNode{preexec}.  If the \xmlNode{preexec} block is not needed, the
MooseBasedApp interface is probably preferable to the Cubit-Moose interface.

Aliases are defined by specifying the variable attribute in an \xmlNode{alias} node with
the internal RAVEN variable name chosen with the node containing the model
variable name.  The Cubit-Moose interface uses the same syntax as the
MooseBasedApp to refer to model variables, with pipes separating terms starting
with the highest YAML block going down to the individual parameter that RAVEN
will change.  To specify variables that are going to be used in the Cubit
journal file, the syntax is "Cubit|aprepro\_var".  The Cubit-Moose interface
will look for the Cubit tag in all variables passed to it and upon finding it,
send it to the Cubit interface.  If the model variable does not begin with \xmlString{Cubit},
the variable MUST be specified in the MooseBasedApp input file.  While the model
variable names are not required to have aliases defined (the \xmlNode{alias}
blocks are optional), it is highly suggested to do so not only to ensure brevity
throughout the RAVEN input, but to easily identify where variables are being sent
in the interface.

An example \xmlNode{Models} block follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Models>
  <Code name="moose-modules" subType="CubitMoose">
    <executable>%FRAMEWORK_DIR%/../../moose/modules/combined/...
      modules-%METHOD%</executable>
    <preexec>/hpc-common/apps/local/cubit/13.2/bin/cubit</preexec>
    <alias variable="length">Cubit@y</alias>
    <alias variable="bot_BC">BCs|bottom|value</alias>
  </Code>
</Models>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Distributions}
The \xmlNode{Distributions} block defines all distributions used to
sample variables in the current RAVEN run.

For all the possible distributions and their possible inputs please
refer to the Distributions chapter (see~\ref{sec:distributions}).
%
It is good practice to name the distribution something similar to what kind of
variable is going to be sampled, since there might be many variables with the
same kind of distributions but different input parameters.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Samplers}
The \xmlNode{Samplers} block defines the variables to be sampled.

After defining a sampling scheme, the variables to be sampled and
their distributions are identified in the \xmlNode{variable} blocks.
The name attribute in the \xmlNode{variable} block must either be the
full MooseBasedApp model variable name or the alias name specified in
\xmlNode{Models}.  If the sampled variable is a geometric property
that will be used to generate a mesh with Cubit, remember the syntax for
variables being passed to journal files (Cubit|aprepro\_var).

For listings of available samplers
refer to the Samplers chapter (see~\ref{sec:Samplers}).

See the following for an example of a grid based sampler for
length and the bottom boundary condition (both of which have aliases
defined in \xmlNode{Models}).

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Samplers>
  <Grid name="Grid_sampling">
    <variable name="length" >
      <distribution>length_dist</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">1.0 2.0</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name="bot_BC">
      <distribution>bot_BC_dist</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">3.0 6.0</grid>
    </variable>
  </Grid>
</Samplers>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Steps,OutStreams,DataObjects}
This interface's \xmlNode{Steps}, \xmlNode{OutStreams}, and
\xmlNode{DataObjects} blocks do not deviate significantly from
other interfaces' respective nodes.  Please refer to previous
entries for these blocks if needed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{File Cleanup}
The Cubit-Moose interface automatically removes files that are commonly
unwanted after the RAVEN run reaches completion. Cubit has been described as
"talkative" due to additional journal files with execution information
being generated by the program after every completed journal file run.
The quantity of these files can quickly become unwieldy if the working
directory is not kept clean; thus these files are removed.  In addition, some users
may wish to remove Exodus files after the RAVEN run is complete as
the typical size of each file is quite large and it is assumed that any
output quantities of interest will be collected by appropriate PostProcessors
and the OutStreams.  Exodus files are not automatically removed,
but by using the \xmlNode{deleteOutExtension} node in \xmlNode{RunInfo}, one
may specify the Exodus extension to save a fair amount of storage space
after RAVEN completes a sequence. For example:

%%%%%%%%%% BISON MESH SCRIPT MOOSE INTERFACE %%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{MooseBasedApp and Bison Mesh Script Interface}
For BISON users, a Python mesh generation script is included in
the \%BISON\_DIR\%/tools/UO2/ directory.  This script generates
3D or 2D (RZ) meshes for nuclear fuel rods using Cubit with
templated commands.  The BISON Mesh Script (BMS) is capable of
generating rods with discrete fuel pellets of various size in
assorted configurations.  To use this interface, Cubit's bin
directory must be added to the user's PYTHONPATH.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Files}
Similar to the Cubit-Moose interface, the BisonAndMesh interface
requires users to specify all files required to run their input
so that these file may be copied into the respective sequence's
working directory.  The user will give each file an internal
RAVEN designation with the name attribute, and the MooseBasedApp
and BISON Mesh Script inputs must be assigned their respective types
in another attribute of the \xmlNode{Input} node.  An example follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Files>
  <Input name='bison_test' type='MooseInput'>simple_bison_test.i</Input>
  <Input name='mesh_in'    type='BisonMeshInput'>coarse_input.py</Input>
  <Input name='other_file' type=''>some_file_moose_input_needs.ext</Input>
</Files>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Models}
The user provides paths to executables and aliases for sampled variables within the
\xmlNode{Models} block.  The \xmlNode{Code} block will contain attributes \xmlAttr{name} and
\xmlAttr{subType}.  \xmlAttr{name} identifies that particular \xmlNode{Code} model within RAVEN, and
\xmlAttr{subType} specifies which code interface the model will use. The \xmlNode{executable}
block should contain the absolute or relative (with respect to the current working
directory) path to the MooseBasedApp that RAVEN will use to run generated input
files.  The absolute or relative path to the mesh script python file is specified within
\xmlNode{preexec}.  If the \xmlNode{preexec} block is not needed, use the
MooseBasedApp interface.

Aliases are defined by specifying the variable attribute in an \xmlNode{alias} node with
the internal RAVEN variable name chosen with the node containing the model
variable name.  The BisonAndMesh interface uses the same syntax as the
MooseBasedApp to refer to model variables, with pipes separating terms starting
with the highest YAML block going down to the individual parameter that RAVEN
will change.  To specify variables that are going to be used in the BISON Mesh Script
python input, the syntax is "Cubit|dict\_name|var\_name".  The interface
will look for the Cubit tag in all variables passed to it and upon finding the tag,
send it to the BISON Mesh Script interface.  If the model variable does not begin with Cubit,
the variable MUST be specified in the MooseBasedApp input file.  While the model
variable names are not required to have aliases defined (the \xmlNode{alias}
blocks are optional), it is highly suggested to do so not only to ensure brevity
throughout the RAVEN input, but to easily identify where variables are being sent
in the interface.

An example \xmlNode{Models} block follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Models>
  <Code name="Bison-opt" subType="BisonAndMesh">
    <executable>%FRAMEWORK_DIR%/../../bison/bison-%METHOD%</executable>
    <preexec>%FRAMEWORK_DIR%/../../bison/tools/UO2/mesh_script.py</preexec>
    <alias variable="pellet_radius" >Cubit@Pellet1|outer_radius</alias>
    <alias variable="clad_thickness">Cubit@clad|clad_thickness</alias>
    <alias variable="fuel_k"        >Materials|fuel_thermal|thermal_conductivity</alias>
    <alias variable="clad_k"        >Materials|clad_thermal|thermal_conductivity</alias>
  </Code>
</Models>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Distributions}
The \xmlNode{Distributions} block defines all distributions used to
sample variables in the current RAVEN run.

For all the possible distributions and their possible inputs please
refer to the Distributions chapter (see~\ref{sec:distributions}).
%
It is good practice to name the distribution something similar to what kind of
variable is going to be sampled, since there might be many variables with the
same kind of distributions but different input parameters.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Samplers}
The \xmlNode{Samplers} block defines the variables to be sampled.

After defining a sampling scheme, the variables to be sampled and
their distributions are identified in the \xmlNode{variable} blocks.
The name attribute in the \xmlNode{variable} block must either be the
full MooseBasedApp model variable name or the alias name specified in
\xmlNode{Models}.  If the sampled variable is a geometric property
that will be used to generate a mesh with Cubit, remember the syntax for
variables being passed to journal files (Cubit|aprepro\_var).

For listings of available samplers
refer to the Samplers chapter (see~\ref{sec:Samplers}).

See the following for an example of a grid based sampler for
length and the bottom boundary condition (both of which have aliases
defined in \xmlNode{Models}).

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Samplers>
  <Grid name="Grid_sampling">
    <variable name="length" >
      <distribution>length_dist</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">1.0 2.0</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name="bot_BC">
      <distribution>bot_BC_dist</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">3.0 6.0</grid>
    </variable>
  </Grid>
</Samplers>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Steps,OutStreams,DataObjects}
This interface's \xmlNode{Steps}, \xmlNode{OutStreams}, and
\xmlNode{DataObjects} blocks do not deviate significantly from
other interfaces' respective nodes.  Please refer to previous
entries for these blocks if needed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{File Cleanup}
The BisonAndMesh interface automatically removes files that are commonly
unwanted after the RAVEN run reaches completion. Cubit has been described as
"talkative" due to additional journal files with execution information
being generated by the program after every completed journal file run.
The BISON Mesh Script creates a journal file to run with cubit after reading input parameters;
so Cubit will generate its "redundant" journal files, and .pyc files will
litter the working directory as artifacts of the python mesh script
reading from the .py input files.  The quantity of these files can quickly
become unwieldy if the working directory is not kept clean, thus these
files are removed.  Some users
may wish to remove Exodus files after the RAVEN run is complete as
the typical size of each file is quite large and it is assumed that any
output quantities of interest will be collected by appropriate postprocessors
and the OutStreams.  Exodus files are not automatically removed,
but by using the \xmlNode{deleteOutExtension} node in \xmlNode{RunInfo}, one
may specify the Exodus extension (*.e) to save a fair amount of storage space
after RAVEN completes a sequence. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<RunInfo>
  ...
  <deleteOutExtension>e</deleteOutExtension>
  ...
</RunInfo>
\end{lstlisting}

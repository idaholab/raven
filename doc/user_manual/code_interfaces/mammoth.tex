%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MAMMOTH (Griffin) Interface}
%
This section covers the input specification for running MAMMOTH through RAVEN.
It is important to notice that this short explanation assumes that the reader already knows how to use MAMMOTH.
The interface can be used to perturb Bison, Rattlesnake, RELAP-7, and general MOOSE input files that utilize
MOOSE's standard YAML input structure as well as Yak multigroup cross section library XML input files.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Files}
\xmlNode{Files} works the same as in other interfaces with name and type
attributes for each node entry.  The \xmlAttr{name} attribute is a user-chosen internal
name for the file contained in the node, and \xmlAttr{type} identifies which base-level
interface the file is used within.  \xmlAttr{type} should be specified for all inputs
used in RAVEN's MultiRun for MAMMOTH (including files not perturbed by RAVEN).
The MAMMOTH input file's \xmlAttr{type} should have \xmlString{MAMMOTHInput} prepended
to the driver app's input specification (e.g. \xmlString{MAMMOTHInput|appNameInput}).
Any other app's input file needs a \xmlAttr{type} with the app's name prepended to \xmlString{Input}
(e.g. \xmlString{BisonInput}, \xmlString{Relap7Input}, etc.).  In addition, the \xmlAttr{type} for any mesh
input is the app in which that mesh is utilized prepended to \xmlString{|Mesh}; so a Bison mesh would have
a \xmlAttr{type} of \xmlString{Bison|Mesh} and similarly a mesh for Rattlesnake would have \xmlString{Rattlesnake|Mesh}
as its \xmlAttr{type}. In cases where a file needs to be copied to each perturbed run
directory (to be used as function input, control logic, etc.), one can use the \xmlAttr{type}
\xmlString{AncillaryInput} to make it clear in the RAVEN input file that this is file
is required for the simulation to run but contains no perturbed parameters.
For Yak multigroup cross section libraries,
the \xmlAttr{type} should be \xmlString{YakXSInput}, and for the Yak
alias files that are used to perturb the Yak multigroup cross section libraries, the \xmlAttr{type} should be
\xmlString{YakXSAliasInput}.

The node should contain the path to the file from the working directory.
The following is an example of a typical \xmlNode{Files} block.
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Files>
  <Input name='mammothInput' type='MAMMOTHInput|RattlesnakeInput'>test_mammoth.i</Input>
  <Input name='crossSection'    type='YakXSInput'>xs.xml</Input>
  <Input name='alias' type='YakXSAliasInput'>alias.xml</Input>
  <Input name='bisonInput'    type='BisonInput'>test_bison.xml</Input>
  <Input name='bisonMesh'    type='Bison|Mesh'>bisonMesh.e</Input>
  <Input name='fuelCTEfunct' type='AncillaryInput'>uo2_CTE.csv</Input>
  <Input name='rattlesnakeMesh'    type='Rattlesnake|Mesh'>rattlesnakeMesh.e</Input>
</Files>
\end{lstlisting}
%
The alias files are employed to define the variables that will be used to perturb Yak multigroup cross section
libraries. Please see the section \ref{RattlesnakeInterfaces} for the example.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Models}
A user provides paths to executables and aliases for sampled variables within the
\xmlNode{Models} block.  The \xmlNode{Code} block will contain \xmlAttr{name} and
\xmlAttr{subType}.  The attribute \xmlAttr{name} identifies that particular \xmlNode{Code} model within RAVEN, and
\xmlAttr{subType} specifies which code interface the model will use. The \xmlNode{executable}
block should contain the absolute or relative (with respect to the current working
directory) path to MAMMOTH that RAVEN will use to run generated input
files.

An example \xmlNode{Models} block follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Models>
  <Code name="Mammoth" subType="MAMMOTH">
    <executable>\%FRAMEWORK_DIR\%/../../mammoth/
     mammoth-%METHOD%</executable>
  </Code>
</Models>
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Distributions}
The \xmlNode{Distributions} block defines all distributions used to
sample variables in the current RAVEN run.

For all the possible distributions and their possible inputs please
refer to the Distributions chapter (see~\ref{sec:distributions}).
%
It is good practice to name the distribution something similar to what kind of
variable is going to be sampled, since there might be many variables with the
same kind of distributions but different input parameters.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Samplers}
The \xmlNode{Samplers} block defines the variables to be sampled.
After defining a sampling scheme, the variables to be sampled and
their distributions are identified in the \xmlNode{variable} blocks.
The \xmlAttr{name} attribute in the \xmlNode{variable} block must either be the
app's name prepended to the full MooseBasedApp model variable name, the alias name specifed in
\xmlNode{Models}, or the variable name specified in the provided alias files.

For listings of available samplers, please refer to the Samplers chapter (see~\ref{sec:Samplers}).
See the following for an example of a grid based sampler used to generate the samples for
the first energy group fission and capture cross sections (both of which have
defined in alias files provided in \xmlNode{Files}), the initial condition temperature defined in Rattlesnake
input file and the Poisson ratio, clad thickness, and gap width defined in Bison input files with clad
and gap parameters calculated using an external function with sampled clad inner and outer diameters
as inputs.
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Samplers>
  <Grid name="Grid_sampling">
    <variable name="Rattlesnake@fission_group_1" >
      <distribution>fission_dist</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">1.0 2.0</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name="Rattlesnake@capture_group_1">
      <distribution>capture_dist</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">3.0 6.0</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name="Rattlesnake@AuxVariables|Temp|initial_condition">
      <distribution>uniform</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">3.0 6.0</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name="Bison@Materials|fuel_solid_mechanics_elastic|poissons_ratio">
      <distribution>normal</distribution>
      <grid type="value" construction="custom">3.0 6.0</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name='clad_outer_diam'>
      <distribution>clad_outer_diam_dist</distribution>
      <grid construction='equal' steps='144' type='CDF'>0.02275 0.97725</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name='clad_inner_diam'>
      <distribution>clad_inner_diam_dist</distribution>
      <grid construction='equal' steps='144' type='CDF'>0.02275 0.97725</grid>
    </variable>
    <variable name='Bison@Mesh|clad_thickness'>
      <function>clad_thickness_calc</function>
    </variable>
    <variable name='Bison@Mesh|clad_gap_width'>
      <function>clad_gap_width_calc</function>
    </variable>
  </Grid>
</Samplers>
\end{lstlisting}
%
In order to make the input variables of one application distinct from input variables of another,
an app's name followed by the '@' symbol is prepended to the variable name (e.g. \xmlString{appName@varName}).
Each variable to be used in an app's input file and sampled in the MAMMOTH interface is required
to have a destination app specified. All variables utilizing Rattlesnake's executable (whether
they are in the Rattlesnake input file or not) are listed as Rattlesnake variables
as that application's interface will sort input file and cross section
variables itself.  Notice that the clad inner and outer diameter sampled parameters have no app
name specified.  These parameters are utilized to sample values used as inputs
for the clad thickness and gap width variables in BISON, so by not specifying a destination
app, these are passed through the interface having only been used in an external function
to calculate parameters usable in an app's input.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Steps}
For a MAMMOTH interface run, the \xmlNode{MultiRun} step type will most likely be used. First, the step needs
to be named: this name will be one of the names used in the \xmlNode{Sequence} block. In our example, \xmlString{Grid\_Mammoth}.
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<MultiRun name='Grid_Mammoth' verbosity='debug'>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>mammothInput</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>crossSection</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>alias</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>bisonInput</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>bisonMesh</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>fuelCTEfunct</Input>
    <Input   class='Files' type=''>rattlesnakeMesh</Input>
    <Model   class='Models' type='Code'>Mammoth</Model>
    <Sampler class='Samplers' type='Grid'>Grid_Samplering</Sampler>
    <Output  class='DataObjects' type='PointSet'>solns</Output>
</MultiRun>
\end{lstlisting}
%
With this step, we need to import all the files needed for the simulation:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item MAMMOTH|Rattlesnake YAML input file;
  \item Yak multigroup cross section libraries input files (XML);
  \item Yak alias files used to define the perturbed variables (XML);
  \item Bison YAML input file;
  \item Bison mesh file;
  \item Bison function file for the fuel's coefficient of thermal expansion as a function of temperature;
  \item Rattlesnake mesh file.
\end{itemize}
As well as \xmlNode{Model}, \xmlNode{Sampler} and outputs, such as \xmlNode{OutStreams} and \xmlNode{DataObjects}.

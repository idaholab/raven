\section{Introduction}
% High-level RAVEN description
RAVEN~\cite{alfonsiMC} ~\cite{alfonsiPSA}~\cite{RAVENFY13}~\cite{ESREL2014} is a software framework that allows the user to perform parametric and stochastic
analysis based on the response of complex system codes.
The initial development was designed to provide dynamic probabilistic risk analysis
capabilities (DPRA) to the thermal-hydraulic code RELAP-7~\cite{relap7FY12}, currently under development
at Idaho National Laboratory (INL).
Now, RAVEN is not only a framework to perform DPRA but it is a
multi-purpose stochastic and uncertainty quantification platform, capable of communicating with any system code.

This report serves as a theoretical manual for selected algorithms implemented within the RAVEN framework. 
It is intended to provide some theorectical treatments of the selected algorithms in the areas of sensitivity
and uncertainty analysis, reduced order modeling, statistical analysus, data mining and DPRA that can help the
user to understand the theory behind the key concepts.

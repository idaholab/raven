\label{HowToRun}

% I don't think this is mentioned earlier? Andrea answers :D It mentioned in the Introduction
%As already mentioned,
The RAVEN code is a blend of \texttt{C++}, \texttt{C}, and \texttt{Python} languages. The entry point
resides on the \texttt{Python} side and is accessible via a command line interface.
%
After following the instructions in the previous Section, RAVEN is ready to be
used.
%
The RAVEN driver is contained in the folder ``\texttt{raven}.''
%
To run RAVEN, open a terminal and use the following command (replace \texttt{inputFileName.xml} with your RAVEN input file):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
python raven/raven_framework.py inputFileName.xml
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, the \texttt{raven\_framework} script can be used.  In this case, the command is:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
raven_framework inputFileName.xml
\end{lstlisting}

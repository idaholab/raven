\section{Making a New RAVEN Plugin}

Creating a new plugin is a straightforward process. It involves setting up a repository,
establishing a basic structure, and installing in RAVEN for testing.

%\subsection{Setting up a Repository}

\subsection{Plugin Structure}
The following directories must be present in the main directory of the plugin in order for RAVEN to
read it correctly:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{src}, where the entities for RAVEN to load are located;
  \item \texttt{doc}, where the documentation for the plugin and its entities is located.
  \item \texttt{tests}, where continuous integration tests are located;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional Libraries}
If the plugin requires additional libraries, they can extend the \texttt{dependencies.ini} file in
the same manner as RAVEN's dependencies file. Libraries will be added like they are for RAVEN
itself, and a check will be performed to assure no base RAVEN (or other plugin) dependencies are
modified.

\subsection{Installing in RAVEN}
Use the installation script in \texttt{raven/install\_plugins.py}.

This process automatically registers the plugin in the plugin directory, and informs the plugin
about RAVEN %(TODO more notes on this!)

\subsection{Adding Testers}
RAVEN automatically provides a testing harness for automated regression testing. This includes a
variety of \emph{testers}, such as CSV checkers and XML checkers.

If a plugin requires additional testers for regression testing, they can be added to the plugin and
loaded by RAVEN's test harness at testing time.

Any new testers should be added under a folder named \texttt{Testers} in the \texttt{src} directory
of the plugin. For example, for a plugin named \texttt{examplePlugin} and a tester named
\texttt{myNewTester}:
\begin{lstlisting}[morekeywords={examplePlugin,myNewTester}]
  /path/to/examplePlugin/src/Testers/myNewTester.py
\end{lstlisting}
Any discovered testers will be made available to the \texttt{tests} files used by the RAVEN
regression test system; for example:
\begin{lstlisting}[morekeywords={myNewTester}]
[Tests]
  [./aTestForMyPlugin]
    type = myNewTester
    input = my_test_input.xml
    csv = 'TestWorkingDir/results.csv'
  [../]
[]
\end{lstlisting}

For more information on inheriting from and creating new testers, see the RAVEN regression system
documentation.

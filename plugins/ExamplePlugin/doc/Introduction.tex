\label{sec:Introduction}
In this section, the developer of an ExternalModel plugin in RAVEN ( \cite{RAVEN} and \cite{RAVENtheoryMan}) should
report a brief description of what the plugin is intended to do.

\subsection{Example Plugin: SumOfExponential}
 In order to show how to develop a plugin, a simple Model that performs a summation
 of exponential (over time (or any monotonic variable)) has been developed:
 \newline
 \begin{math}
        Xi(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} coef_i*e^{var_i*t}
  \end{math}
  \newline
 where:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item $var_i$ is the $i-th$ variable (sampled by RAVEN). It is used as exponent of the 
            $exp$ function
   \item $coef_i$ is the $i-th$  coefficient for the exponential having as exponent the  
            variable $var_i$
   \item $t$ is the independent variable (monotonic variable).
 \end{itemize}

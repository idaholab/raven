This is an example of a PLUGIN structure for ExternalModel(s)

Each plugin folder should be organized as follows:
- src folder containing the plugin source code (see Manual on how to create one):
./plugins/PluginName/src
- tests folder containing the tests that are needed to test the plugin linked with RAVEN:
./plugins/PluginName/tests
- doc folder containing the plugin manual in LatEX:
./plugins/PluginName/doc

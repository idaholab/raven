This is the git repository for CashFlow.
CashFlow is a plugin for the RAVEN code.

The plugin enables the capability to compute the NPV (Net Present Value), the IRR (Internal Rate of Return) and the PI (Profitability Index) with RAVEN. Furthermore, it is possible to do an NPV, IRR or PI search, i.e. CashFlow will compute a multiplicative value (for example the production cost) so that the NPV, IRR or PI has a desired value. The plugin allows for a generic definition of cash flows which drivers are provided by RAVEN. Furthermore, CashFlow includes flexible options to deal with taxes, inflation, discounting and offers  capabilities to compute a combined cash flow for components with different component lives.

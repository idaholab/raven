This folder contains the plugins of RAVEN that
are downloadable by submodule (or manually installed).
Each plugin folder should be organized as follows:
- src folder containing the plugin source code (see Manual on how to create one):
  ./plugins/PluginName/src
- tests folder containing the tests that are needed to test the plugin linked with RAVEN:
  ./plugins/PluginName/tests
- doc folder containing the plugin manual in LatEX:
  ./plugins/PluginName/doc

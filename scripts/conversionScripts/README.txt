Conversion scripts for maintaining input files.

To modify a single input file ('test.xml'), navigate to the directory
containing the test and run

python path/to/conversion/script.py test.xml

To run the conversion script on all the regression tests currently in
RAVEN, from anywhere run

python path/to/conversion/script.py --tests

To simply assure a file ('text.xml') is in the official "prettified" 
format without changing the contents, run

python path/to/raven/scripts/conversionScripts/standard.py test.xml

To avoid to rewrite the a file ('text.xml') in case no changes in the content
Are detected use the command line variable --no-rewrite. For example:

python path/to/conversion/script.py --tests â€”-no-rewrite

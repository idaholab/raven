    This method is designed to identify the set of non-dominated points (nEfficientPoints)

    If returnMask=True, then a True/False mask (isEfficientMask) is returned
    Non-dominated points pFront can be obtained as follows:
      mask = nonDominatedFrontier(data,True)
      pFront = data[np.array(mask)]

    If returnMask=False, then an array of integer values containing the indexes of the non-dominated points is returned
    Non-dominated points pFront can be obtained as follows:
      mask = nonDominatedFrontier(data,False)
      pFront = data[np.array(mask)]

    @ In, data, np.array, data matrix (nPoints, nCosts) containing the data points
    @ In, returnMask, bool, type of data to be returned: indices (False) or True/False mask (True)
    @ Out, isEfficientMask , np.array, data matrix (nPoints,1), array  of boolean values if returnMask=True
    @ Out, isEfficient, np.array, data matrix (nEfficientPoints,1), integer array of indexes if returnMask=False

        than using the magnitude of the gradient to determine step size, the directional change of the
        gradient versor determines whether to take larger or smaller steps. If the gradient in two successive
        steps changes direction, the step size shrinks. If the gradient instead continues in the same
        direction, the step size grows. The rate of shrink and growth are controlled by the \xmlNode{shrinkFactor}
        and \xmlNode{growthFactor}. Note these values have a large impact on the optimization path taken.
        Large growth factors converge slowly but explore more of the input space; large shrink factors

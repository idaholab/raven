        using Finite Difference approximation. Finite difference makes use of orthogonal perturbations
        in each dimension of the input space to estimate the local gradient, requiring a total of $N$
        perturbations, where $N$ is dimensionality of the input space. For example, if the input space
        $\mathbf{i} = (x, y, z)$ for objective function $f(\mathbf{i})$, then FiniteDifference chooses
        three perturbations $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ and evaluates the following perturbation points:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item $f(x+\alpha, y, z)$,
          \item $f(x, y+\beta, z)$,
          \item $f(x, y, z+\gamma)$
        \end{itemize}
        and evaluates the gradient $\nabla f = (\nabla^{(x)} f, \nabla^{(y)} f, \nabla^{(z)} f)$ as
        \begin{equation*}
          \nabla^{(x)}f \approx \frac{f(x+\alpha, y, z) - f(x, y, z)}{\alpha},
        \end{equation*}
        and so on for $ \nabla^{(y)}f$ and $\nabla^{(z)}f$.

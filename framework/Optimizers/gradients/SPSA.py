        using the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA).
        SPSA makes use of a single perturbation as a zeroth-order gradient approximation,
        requiring exactly $1$
        perturbation regardless of the dimensionality of the input space. For example, if the input space
        $\mathbf{i} = (x, y, z)$ for objective function $f(\mathbf{i})$, then SPSA chooses
        a single perturbation point $(\epsilon^{(x)}, \epsilon^{(y)}, \epsilon^{(z)})$ and evaluates
        the following perturbation point:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item $f(x+\epsilon^{(x)}, y+\epsilon^{(y)}, z+\epsilon^{(z)})$
        \end{itemize}
        and evaluates the gradient $\nabla f = (\nabla^{(x)} f, \nabla^{(y)} f, \nabla^{(z)} f)$ as
        \begin{equation*}
          \nabla^{(x)}f \approx \frac{f(x+\epsilon^{(x)}, y+\epsilon^{(y)}, z+\epsilon^{(z)})) -
              f(x, y, z)}{\epsilon^{(x)}},
        \end{equation*}
        and so on for $ \nabla^{(y)}f$ and $\nabla^{(z)}f$. This approximation is much less robust
        than FiniteDifference or CentralDifference, but has the benefit of being dimension agnostic.

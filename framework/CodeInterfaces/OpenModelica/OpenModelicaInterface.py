comments: Interface for OpenModelica Simulation

OpenModelica (http://www.openmodelica.org) is an open souce implementation of the Modelica simulation language.
This module provides an interface that allows RAVEN to utilize models built using OpenModelica.

General flow:

A Modelica model is specified in a text file.  For example (BouncingBall.mo):

--- BEGIN MODEL FILE ---
model BouncingBall
  parameter Real e=0.7 "coefficient of restitution";
  parameter Real g=9.81 "gravity acceleration";
  Real h(start=1) "height of ball";
  Real v "velocity of ball";
  Boolean flying(start=true) "true, if ball is flying";
  Boolean impact;
  Real v_new;
  Integer foo;

equation
  impact = h <= 0.0;
  foo = if impact then 1 else 2;
  der(v) = if flying then -g else 0;
  der(h) = v;

  when {h <= 0.0 and v <= 0.0,impact} then
    v_new = if edge(impact) then -e*pre(v) else 0;
    flying = v_new > 0;
    reinit(v, v_new);
  end when;

end BouncingBall;
--- END MODEL FILE ---

When OpenModelica simulates this file it is read, and from it C code is generated and then built into a platform-specific
executable that does the calculations.  The parameters from the model are written into an XML file (by default
BouncingBall_init.xml).  After the executable is generated it may be run multiple times.  There are several way to vary
input parameters:

  1) Modify the model file and re-build the simulation executable.
  2) Change the value(s) in the input XML generated as part of the model build process.
  3) Use a command-line parameter '-override <var>=<value>' to substitute something for the value in the XML input
  4) Use a command-line parameter '-overrideFile=<file>' to use a completely different XML input file.
  5) Use a command-line parameter '-iif=<file>' to specify initial conditions using a file in the .MAT format used
     for output.
  6) Paramters in the model file may also be overriden when the simulation executable is built using an OpenModelica
     shell command of the form: simulate(<model>, simflags="-override <var>=<value>)

For RAVEN purposes, this interface code will use option (2).  Variation of parameters may be done by editing the init
file and then re-running the model.  The OpenModelica shell provides a method that may be used to change a parameter:

  setInitXmlStartValue(<input file>, <parameter>, <new value>, <output file>)

To change the initial height of the bouncing ball to 5.0 in the above model, and write it back to a different input
file BouncingBall_new_init.xml.  It is also possible to write the output over the original file:

  setInitXmlStartValue("BouncingBall_init.xml", "h", "5.0", "BouncingBall_new_init.xml")

The output of the model may be configured to a number of output formats.  The default is a binary file <Model Name>_res.mat
(BouncingBall_res.mat for this example).  CSV is also an option, which we will use because that is what RAVEN likes best.
The output type may be set when generating the model executable.

To generate the executable, use the OM Shell:
  The generate phase builds C code from the modelica file and then builds an executable.  It also generates an initial
  init file <model>_init.xml for <model>.mo.  This xml can then be modified and used to re-run the simulation.

        (Using the OpenModelica Shell, load the base Modelica library)
        >> loadModel(Modelica)
        (Load the model to build)
        >> loadFile("BouncingBall.mo")
        (Build the model into an executable and generate the initial XML input file specifying CSV output)
        >> buildModel(BouncingBall, outputFormat="csv")
        (Copy the input file to BouncingBall_new_init.xml, changing the initial value of h to 5.0)
  >> setInitXmlStartValue("BouncingBall_init.xml", "h", "5.0", "BouncingBall_new_init.xml")

Alternatively, the python OM Shell interface may be used:

  >>> from OMPython import OMCSession                # Get the library with OMCSession
  >>> omc = OMCSession()                             # Creates a new shell session
  >>> omc.execute(<OpenModelica Shell Command>)      # General form
  >>> omc.execute("loadModel(Modelica)")             # Load base Modelica library
  >>> omc.execute("loadFile(\"BouncingBall.mo\")")   # Load BouncingBall.mo model
        >>> omc.execute("buildModel(BouncingBall, outputFormat=\"csv\")")  # Build the model (but not run it), setting for csv file output
  >>> omc.execute("setInitXmlStartValue(\"BouncingBall_init.xml\",         # Make a new input file with h = 5.0
    \"h\", \ "5.0\", \"BouncingBall_new_init.xml\")")
  >>> omc.execute("system(\"BouncingBall.exe\")")    # Run the model executable
  >>> omc.execute("simulate(BouncingBall, stopTime=10.0)")                 # Run simulation, changing stop time to 10.0

An alternative would be to take the default .mat output type and use the open source package based on SciPy called DyMat
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/DyMat) may be used to convert these output files to human-readable forms (including CSV).  For example:

  <Python Code>
  import DyMat, DyMat.Export                      # Import necessary modules
  d = DyMat.DyMatFile("BouncingBall_res.mat")     # Load the result file
  d.names()                                       # Prints out the names in the result file
  DyMat.Export.export("CSV", d, ["h", "flying"])  # Export variables h and flying to a CSV file

Example of multiple parameter override (option 3 above): BouncingBall.exe -override "h=7,g=7,v=2"

To use RAVEN, we need to be able to perturb the input and output files from the defaults.  The command line
form of this is: (Where the output file will be of the type originally configured)

  <executable> -f <init file xml> -r <outputfile>

comments: Interface for Dymola Simulation

Modelica is an object-oriented, equation-based language to conveniently model complex physical systems containing,
e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.
Modelica models (with a file extension of .mo) are built, translated (compiled), and simulated in Dymola (http://www.modelon.com/products/dymola/),
which is a commercial modeling and simulation environment based on the Modelica modeling language.
This module provides an interface that allows RAVEN to utilize Modelica models built using Dymola.

General flow:

A Modelica model is built and implemented in Dymola. For example (BouncingBall.mo):

--- BEGIN MODEL FILE ---
model BouncingBall
  parameter Real e=0.7 "coefficient of restitution";
  parameter Real g=9.81 "gravity acceleration";
  parameter Real hstart = 10 "height of ball at time zero";
  parameter Real vstart = 0 "velocity of ball at time zero";
  Real h(start=hstart,fixed=true) "height of ball";
  Real v(start=vstart,fixed=true) "velocity of ball";
  Boolean flying(start=true) "true, if ball is flying";
  Boolean impact;
  Real v_new;
  Integer foo;

equation
  impact = h <= 0.0;
  foo = if impact then 1 else 2;
  der(v) = if flying then -g else 0;
  der(h) = v;

  when {h <= 0.0 and v <= 0.0,impact} then
    v_new = if edge(impact) then -e*pre(v) else 0;
    flying = v_new > 0;
    reinit(v, v_new);
  end when;

  annotation (uses(Modelica(version="3.2.1")),
    experiment(StopTime=10, Interval=0.1),
    __Dymola_experimentSetupOutput);

end BouncingBall;
--- END MODEL FILE ---

When a modelica model, e.g., BouncingBall model, is implemented in Dymola, the platform dependent C-code from a Modelica model
and the corresponding executable code (i.e., by default dymosim.exe on the Windows operating system) are generated for simulation.
A separate TEXT file (by default dsin.txt) containing model parameters and initial conditions are also generated as part of the build process.
After the executable is generated, it may be run multiple times (with Dymola license). There are several ways to vary input parameters:

  1) Modify the model file and re-build the simulation executable.
  2) Change the value(s) in the 'text' input file generated as part of the model build process.
  3) Use a completely different text input file for each run.
  4) Use the Matlab script file (m-file) or Python Dymola Shell interface to manipulate (perturb) input parameters.

For RAVEN purposes, this interface code will use option (2). Variation of parameters may be done by editing the input
file (dsin.txt) and then re-running the model executable (by default dymosim.exe).

An executable (dymosim.exe) and a simulation initialization file (dsin.txt) can be generated after either translating or simulating the Modelica
model (BouncingBall.mo) using the Dymola Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Dymola Application Programming Interface (API)-routines.
The output of the model is a binary file 'BouncingBall.mat' if the simulation is run in Dymola GUI or by using Dymola API-routines.
If the generated executable code is trigged directly from a command prompt, the output file is always named as 'dsres.mat'.

To change the initial height of the bouncing ball to 5.0 in the above model, we need to read and modify its value
from the 'dsin.txt,' and write it back to a different input file, e.g., DMdsin.txt. This .txt file can then be used
to re-run the simulation.

The default .mat output type needs to be converted to human-readable forms, i.e., .csv output. Note that the Python
interface that comes with the Dymola distribution cannot be used, especially when running the model with RAVEN on
cluster, as the Python interface is currently only supported on Windows.

To use RAVEN, we need to be able to perturb the input and output files from the defaults. The command line form
of this is:

  <executable> -s <dsin file text> <outputfile>

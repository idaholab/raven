This module is the base class for Input Templates, which use an established input
template as an accelerated way to write new RAVEN workflows. Other templates
can inherit from this base class for specific applications.

  # naming templates
  ## this dictionary of templates can be used to standardize naming throughout a template.
  ## for example, variables in a template might always have the form source_contents, e.g.
  ## "model_samples" or "rom_meta". In this case, a standardized naming format might look
  ## like '{source}_{content}', so that the variables can be consistently named as
  ## self.namingTemplates['variable'].format(source='model', content='samples'). Register
  ## new templates by calling (for example) self.addNamingTemplate({'variable':'{source}_{content}'})
  ## This is an optional tool, and in no way needs to be used to build templates.

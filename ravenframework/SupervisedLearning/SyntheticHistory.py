        a variety of TimeSeriesAnalysis (TSA) algorithms to characterize and generate new
        signals based on training signal sets. It is a more general implementation of the ARMA ROM. The available
        algorithms are discussed in more detail below. The SyntheticHistory ROM uses the TSA algorithms to
        characterize then reproduce time series in sequence; for example, if using Fourier then ARMA, the
        SyntheticHistory ROM will characterize the Fourier properties using the Fourier TSA algorithm on a
        training signal, then send the residual to the ARMA TSA algorithm for characterization. Generating
        new signals works in reverse, first generating a signal using the ARMA TSA algorithm then
        superimposing the Fourier TSA algorithm.

  Inverse linear fitness method where the fitness value is inversely proportional to the objective function.
  For minimization problems:
  1. As the objective decreases (closer to min), the fitness value increases.
  2. As the objective increases (away from the min), the fitness value decreases.
  3. If the solution violates the constraints, the fitness decreases, making it less favorable.
  For maximization problems, the objective value is negated, inverting the trends.

  3.  If a solution violates constraints, the fitness decreases, making it less favorable.
